D10 Cursed Narcotics

category: Powers & Weirdness
1. **Scuttle** Each snorted dose of this brown powder lasts for D2 hours. During that time climbing and squeezing into gaps is significantly easier. Test Toughness DR8 to avoid painfully moulting your entire skin, and emerging as something slightly less human.
2. **Fairy Wings** If you're lucky enough to find a fairy, pluck her wings out! Their eyes are also great, just put them on your tongue and let them dissolve. The trip has a 25% chance of being a bad one (roll arcane catastrophe that doesn't mention scrolls or adjust them) A good trip will let your soul melt, your flesh mutate and your mind expand. Gain +3 to all Presence tests for the day, you can't be manipulated but your body fuses with everything you touch for the day.
3. **Prisoner’s Honey** Distilled from the minds of those tortured by the Cannibal Warlocks of the Seven Masters, a dose of Prisoner’s Honey sends the imbiber on a trip down the lanes of someone else’s memories. A difficult presence test is required to see if you can find your way back to your own mind, but perhaps one can find solace from the Dying World in the dreams of others.
4. **Wine of Psalms** A glass of this rare tincture, infused with mold grown on the rotting pages of ancient and unholy tomes, will send your soul back to a more pleasant time. For 1d6 hours you may pick one Misery that has already befallen the world to ignore - you do not notice or remember it, and it does not affect you. After that time, roll another Misery - only you can see it, and it only affects you, for twice that length afterwards. Drinking when no Miseries have occurred just makes you feel calm until the pleasant part wears off, and drinking when six have occurred produces an immediate and spectacular occult death after the initial time is up.
5. **Burning Salt** Black salt that tastes of soot and fire, can be taken by snorting or by putting it on food. After taking it you lose your sense of smell and taste, you do not feel heat, take no damage or effects from burning, after an hour the damage comes back unless it was already healed. Each time you take it there is a 1 in 6 chance that you transform into a statue made of burning salt.
6. **Tears of the Dead** A fine powder, place it into your eyes to be able to converse with anything you’ve killed. Consume orally to bring about a crushing sense of regret and guilt. Produced from the caked up, dried layers of blood on a weapon. In addition to conversing with the dead, it can be used to temporarily revive a dead person for D20 times 10 seconds. Tastes like copper and remorse. After extended use, you will slowly lose touch with your physical body.
7. **Malted Marrow** Leftover bones of the rotted and hanged, whose bone-goo has obtained a lustrous, waxen flavor. Consume for a one-time boost of d6 hit points, although in the aftermath of consumption your skin grows gray and flakey, eventually sloughing off in a particularly unpleasant manner.
8. **Fool's Virtue** This sickly sweet substance resembles a mixture of coagulated blood and bitter wine, and upon consuming it, the drinker becomes unbearably narcissistic and arrogant. For 2d6 hours, whenever the user takes damage, they can test Presence DR 12. On a success, the narcotic's duration ends early. On a failure, the user takes no damage, their vapid, self-absorption so potent that it warps their body from receiving harm. If the narcotic's duration ends normally, the user fades from their hubristic stupor having a blurry recollection of the past few hours. However, if the narcotic ends due to a successful Presence test, the user suddenly realises their immense physical trauma, and immediately loses HP equal to the amount of total damage they negated during the narcotic's duration.
9. **Popeium** An intricate, bone white pipe stolen from a clique of prestigious Galgenbeck priests. For as long as the pipe is smoked, a dim holy aura surrounds the user that acts as heavy armor (-d6 damage, DR+4 on Agility tests, defense is DR+2) but allows scroll usage. Popeium can be smoked for d4+1 hours and typically forces the user to shout whenever speaking. Highly heretical to keep for yourself.
10. **Candied Goblin Guts** A strange food coming from a small shop in Grift. As the name implies. It is the disemboweled organs of a goblin, left to stew and ferment in a barrel of sugar. Can cure the goblin curse if ingested a few minutes after being attacked. After ingesting any amount over 10 candied organs the consumer will turn the next creature they attack into an identical clone of the attacker.
