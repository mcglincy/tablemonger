category: Lost Souls All
11. A set of jacks; while playing, players must swallow one for every round they lose or be cursed for life.
12. **Box Turtle**: in a pinch will function as a shield. Price: One entire fingernail. HP 2 Morale - Attack d2
13. A wooden duck on wheels you can pull behind you on a string, everytime you pull, someone has problems breathing, the duck decides who.
14. A sentient nut cracker. has a taste for fingers.
15. **Stuffed animal**. It is literally the skin of a small but vicious dog, stuffed to the brim with maggots. It is almost bursting! Might better throw it away before it explodes!
16. **Small brass piccolo**, hypnotizes children  and those who are young-at-heart. No matter your skill level, music always comes out sounding like a demented version of "Pure Imagination".
21. A little toy wagon, when you pull it backwards a little and let go, it will shoot forward (d6 dmg)
22. A porcelain goblin doll with real goblin hair, that goblin is still alive though, and bald. And whoever touches this doll gets the curse and has to find and kill the bald goblin in d6 days to not turn into a beautiful, pale goblin.
23. A little rectangular mirror. When you touch a dent on the bottom of it, it will hold the image it reflected then for as long as you don't touch that dent again.
24. A wooden sword. First hit (if stabbed) does d6 dmg, breaks and gets shorter, does d4 dmg now. Breaks again during the second stab, becomes useless then.
25. **Bag of "Marbles"**. Actually a bag of eyeballs. Not magical, just gross. Somehow they always roll in such a way to be looking directly at you.
26. One of those wind-up chattering teeth things. Literally something's jawbones, with many sharp teeth. Wind it up and it will act on your initiative, randomly biting nearby creatures. d4 dmg?
31. A spinning top that never stops spinning unless interrupted. Generates Increasingly high pitched whine, testing presence and dealing d4 psychic damage each round to everyone within earshot. You feel compelled to let it spin and the colors are so... pretty...  If someone else stops the spin, rage at them. (ehh this one needs work)
32. A marionette of a dragon. Presence DR14 to breathe fire for d6 damage.
33. A music box with an eerie melody... very rarely (definitely the first time however) when played, you will hear the voice of a nearby creature (humans are creatures as well), singing along, this creepy lullaby:\n\n*Fate has been cruel, the world unkind.\nOh ride oh little pony mine,\nJump and break my father's spine.\nOnly that will calm my mind*
34. **Hag Matryoshka**. Pretty woman > Creepy hag > innocent child.  Swallow the child and replenish a use of one of your powers. "Your mind is a matryoshka. Be careful, what's inside could be even worse."
35. **Teddy bear** frankenstein'd out of other, less fortunate teddy bears.
36. **Brass wind-up clockwork duck** - choose how many turns of the key you wind it for, which reduce by one per round. Past 1d12 turns, it attacks an enemy randomly with insane ferocity. Past (a different) 1d12 turns, it attacks you or a friend randomly with insane ferocity - if both of the above, attacks anyone at random. If wound past a differently-rolled 1d20 turns of the key, the spring is overtightened and it explodes into shrapnel for 1d8 damage to everyone nearby. Flies around on metal wings, DR 15 to hit, 4 HP, 1d6 razor-sharp beak.
41. A ball. Made out of an unclean creatures bladder, coated with the leather of goblin faces, filled with air, but as it is rotting from the inside it only gains pressure. Don't be around when it bursts...
42. A little monkey with cymbals. It actually is a zombie monkey, restrained by its circus-like clothing. It can only move its arms and head, and the arms only a little, enough to play the cymbals though. Strip the monkey to unleash its fury!
43. **Stick horse** with a stuffed pony's head. It's stuffed with teeth, a bit heavy. Can be used as a club (d4), infects the target on a crit as some rotten teeth get stuck in the target.
44. A small collection of miniature toy building bricks, made from corrupted sea urchins. When in contact with the ground, their color will shift to blend with their surroundings (DR14 presence), and a protective layer of spines will protect them from being stepped on. Spines deal d6 damage, and the brick must be removed before moving or suffer additional damage.
45. **Knucklebones** that can predict one's future, now etched by a toymaker with dentistry tools to be weighted towards happy prediction. Can't have the kids as sad as the toymaker, not today...
46. **Cursed Slinky**, now when pushed it always falls uphill. Metal is rusted and brittle, but it always slinks upwards.
51. A finger trap, except you can't loosen it. Have to cut the finger off now.
52. A "lucky" die which, as long as its on your person, grants +1d6 to all d20 rolls. If the d6 comes up a 1 the action fails in the worst way possible (as if rolled a 1 on the d20).
53. **Worry Worm**. Creeps along, making you nervous. -2 PRE for everyone within 30', but while within range of the Worry Worm, the Toymaker always succeeds at using powers. Price: one tongue. HP 2 Morale - Attack -
54. **Crayons of creation**. Drawing becomes animated for 1h and with 1d8 HP per level of artist, roll randomly for armor and weapon if not specified. Make a reaction roll to find out of your creation ignores, helps, or murders you. Treat snake eye as: "poses as ally but betrays you in the worst possible moment". Creatures must be at least goblin and at most human sized.
55. **Crisped kite**. Burnt around the edges, but clearly in the shape of SHE. Always channels lightning down the string during a storm, dealing 2d6 damage to whoever is holding the string.
56. **Trading Scroll Game scrolls**. A scroll case with 2d6 scrolls that have blasphemic and occult imagery on them, the text is illegible. Even people that can't read can use these small scrolls to summon the depicted creatures. Sadly they are just as small, going up to your knee maybe, and have just one HP, deal only one damage and can't speak, no matter what creature you summon. At least they follow all your commands.
61. **Sap Ducky**. A duck made of tree sap. The sap is quite fresh, it's very sticky, will stick to anything, also hands. Might peel your skin off if you can get it off with a DR14 Strength test. Can be used as floating device. Or as a club. But it sticks to enemies as well...
62. A pacifier. Sucking on this releases neurotoxins, permanently putting you to sleep.
63. A little Gnome friend. A gnome on a leash, hates everyone, speaks in a language only Pale One's will understand. Bites if cornered. Tries to break free constantly. Unleashes an arcane catastrophy on the one holding the leash as soon as it does brake free. A random scroll is cast if killed. Of high value only to otherworldly merchants.
64. **Black Wraith deck**. A deck of blackjack cards with grim imagery. Invite another character to play. If he or she agrees the game begins. Both characters test presence. the winner will take off a level (or 5 max. hp) of the loser. The game continues until both characters decide to quit or one character dies. The winner consumes the losers soul and gains a level, and recovers lost max. HP at a rate of 1 per day.
65. **The Handthrower**. A wind-up fighter toy that launches cursed monkey hands at targets.
66. **Tiny Tea Set**. It's really tiny, with a tiny table. Everyone that agrees to have a tea party with you at this cursed table with this demon's tea set of the blood realm, will obey your every command for the next d4 hours.
