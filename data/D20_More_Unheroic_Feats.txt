D20 More Unheroic Feats
1. **Improvisational Slaughter**. You can take anything and surely kill with it. Deal d6 damage with femurs and improvised weapons. Additionally you may break a femur or improvised weapon when you hit something with it, dealing maximum damage with that strike.
2. **Saved by Fate**. Perhaps you are intended for a greater purpose, or a greater tragedy. Whenever you would spend an omen to reduce damage by d6, you instead take no damage.
3. **Frightful Visions**. A true prophet is one who contacts beings from beyond to know things they should not. You hear whispers from an alternate self, in some other place and some other time. By consuming an omen and taking a moment in meditation you may ask your Player a question which they may respond to truthfully or otherwise, as they see fit.
4. **BERSERK**. You slaughter everything in your path. Whenever you roll damage roll the dice twice and pick the highest. You have DR 14 to Dodge and must pass a DR 14 Presence check or attack your allies when your enemies are wasted. Repeat this check once per round.
5. **Precognition**. You have an impeccable ability for foresight. At the beginning of each day roll a d20 and record the result, for 24 hours you can replace any d20 roll with the recorded result.
6. **Durable**. At the start of each day you can roll a d10, you gain that many HP for the day. The extra HP goes away after 24 hours.
7. **Clumsy Friend or foe**. Everyone fears you on the battlefield for they never know when they will get their head accidentally chopped off. Whenever you crit fail, roll damage for the weapon you are holding and deal damage equal to the result to all creatures around you.
8. ****Skin scribe. With some spare time and a sharp razor you can skin an enemy and improvise a random unclean scroll with it once a day. These scrolls rot after d4 days.
9. **Headless**. Who needs such a silly thing? All it does is get in your way. Agility tests are -4DR and you ignore fumbles on your defense rolls. You cannot read scrolls anymore and you must spend an omen at the start of each day for the Headless God to continue your cursed unsight.
10. **Blood so much blood why is there so much blood**. Every time you draw blood on an enemy (or yourself). The wound will violently erupt in a fountain of blood that will blind any nearby attacker. You, having gone through these ordeal before, have learned to look past the sea of crimson in the air and gain advantage on the next attack roll. On yourself, any damage is doubled.
11. **Sophisticate Steath**. You've one of those faces which blends into the crowd. The DR of hiding amongst or pick-potting in a group of people is reduced by 2 and can be rolled with Agility or Presence.  In addition, you add +1 to each reaction roll
12. **Monkey Stance**. You make do. Gain +1 to attack and damage rolls with a femur and can choose to make a flailing flurry on your turn. In a flailing flurry you may make any combination of 4 unarmed attacks and femur attacks, all at DR18.
13. **Corpse bird-caller**. You are able enough to imitate any kind of sound you have ever heard using  a corpse or an air-filled gut (You start with d4 guts), attracting or confusing rivals and animals if they don't pass a Presence roll with DR 14.
14. **Organ Grinder**. On a successful attack with a blunt weapon, make a DR10 presence check. If you succeed, a clear, pure tone erupts from the mouth of your victim. If you produce three such notes in successive attacks, your allies gain the benefit of -2DR for all melee and defense tests for the remainder of this combat as they revel in your cheerful music.
15. **Baptized By Fire**. Being born in the flames of demons makes mortal fires feel like nothing in comparison. Non-magical fire does no damage to you but your skin and bones easily catch fire and do not go out on their own.
16. **The Haruspex**. You can read the future in entrails. Different entrails give different types of readings. 1) Fowl - [d3] You can see any single above ground area as it [1] is, [2] was, or [3] might be. 2) Caprinae - [d6] You can [1] see nothing, but at least you get to eat lamb/goat today, feeding the party. [2-3] cure an infected character, [4-6] heal a character 1d6 hit points. 3) Cervidae - Roll 2d20 and mark down the results. Replace the next 2 attacks made by you or a character of your choice that are lower than the marked numbers with the marked numbers. If you use this ability again, replace any remaining numbers. 4) Bovine - Arguably less effective than tyromancy, you can see: [d4]: [1-3] Visions relating to a single question. [d4] The best cheese in the vicinity. 5) Reptilian - Strange guts, a rare specimen. You can see [d8]: [1-2] through the eyes of another living person, but for a minute.[3-5] Who a person directly answers to. [6-8] What their immediate motivations are. 6) Human -The most powerful insides belong to other humans, who knew? You can see [2d10, picking 2 results]: [1-2] How they died, [3] Their dietary habits, [4] Where they were from, [5] Who their parents were, [6] What their last moments were like, [7] You can discern a single word answer to a question you ask the body, [8] You discern their feelings and motivation for the single thing they felt the most emotion towards,[9] You discern their immediate future, had they not died. [0] Who they spent their time with the most. On the result of two 10s, instead of choosing two, you learn absolutely everything about the person, including how they would probably answer  d4 questions. But further haruspicy will be inaccurate for the next week.
17. **Spectral Blood**. A ghost on your father's side. -1 damage from Ghosts and Wraiths and you may spend a Power as an action to become incorporeal until your next turn. Being incorporeal means you are unable to make any actions other than move, but you can move through objects. in addition you take no damage from physical forces.
18. **Bloodlion's Roar**. Send those weaklings running and lead the strong to battle. On your turn you may use a Power and make a DR12 Strength check to let out a powerful battlecry. Until the end of the next round, this battlecry grants -2DR to melee attacks you and your allies make and gives -2 to all enemies' Morale.
19. **Goliath Killer**. You've learnt to strike at weak points with the crushing might of stone. Your sling attacks treat armor as if it were one tier less. In addition, dealing max damage with a sling will fracture an enemy's bone and make the DR to hit them 1 less for the rest of combat.
20. **Revenant**. If you reach 0HP but have another human dead body near, you can possess if passing a Presence DR12 roll. You recover all your original stats minus 1. The body turns useless after d4 days. You stink and are too ill-looking, accumulative -2 to Presence for social interactions each day.
