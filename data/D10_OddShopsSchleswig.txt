category: The Dying World
1. **Doctor Krippan's Beautification Services** Pampered and polished your exterior, but still can't do anything about what's under the skin? For a fee, Dr Krippan will happily conduct surgery in his spotless laboratory to remove mostly-unnecessary internal organs and give you the figure you crave, no matter how radical the desired result (lose 1d6HP permanently, more for the extremities of fashion). Appointments required, consent forms must be signed by somebody, unfortunate medical incidents discretely disposed of. Also serves delicious meat pies to waiting customers - these are not of course derived from removed organs, what an absurd suggestion, the organs go to Those Who Wait Beneath, who get very hungry.
2. **An unmarked door** Home of the Finkam family, who'll buy any body part--monster or otherwise--for twice its regular value. They'll leave town in d20 days though, leaving the building empty save for a locked chest containing a venomous snake and an upset goblin.
3. **The Potion Shop** Sells the strongest potions you could imagine. However, the shopkeep refuses to sell them to you; you're not strong enough to handle his potions.
4. **The Bloodsmith** Bring her blood, depending on how much and from what creature, she will forge armor with blood, fire and magic. That armor will heal you when blood is spilled and heal the enemy when the armor is hit.
5. **The Bellman** Sells bells of different sizes that, when worn on clothing, supposedly ward against evil, undead, illness and whatnot.  Do they work? Maybe. But the ringing of the bells makes sneaking impossible.
6. **Magic shop** It is said to give you the magic item you were looking for, one that redirects your life to a shining future! It's a metal door with a little opening. "Place coin there" is written in tar above the opening. Depending on the amount of silver spent one will receive a random magic item. Something nobody warned you about: They are never useful.
7. **Why am I here?** A fun little shop behind a colorful door. Join stepping through all entities forget why they entered. The shop sells trinkets and charms that upon being held implant different thoughts into the holder's mind. Leaving is extraordinarily difficult due to the disorienting layout, and repeatingly ugly colorful geometric patterns on the walls. Every salesman is human but indistinguishable. Upon looking away from them you completely forget any features about them.
8. **A simple barbershop** A popular barbershop situated above a pie shop, opens at midday and closes late in the evening. The barber inside claims it's so people can visit after work. The pie shop opens regular hours, but the head baker seems to be in before dawn to prep the pies. (Anyone who doesn't get the reference, go read a penny dreadful)
9. **Odd Bodkin's Curios and Oddities** Every nook and cranny of this quaint little shop is filled with dusty books or crumbling boxes with mysterious labels written in foreign tongues. It is said that you can find almost anything at Odd's — except Odd himself. (No ones ever seen the shopkeep.) Be wary, for you may find your heart's desire, but it will come at a price. And the price will be paid.
10. **Järnspik and Sons** The world has never seen this amount of rusty nails in the same place before. The chaos that first meets the eye starts to make sense as soon as the shopkeeper and their sons start guiding their customers through it. The assortment ranges from plain rusty nails used to close off old doors with, to larger ones that soften on your command and small ones to pulverise and use as performance enhancements. This shop keeps a nail for every purpose. Every purpose.
