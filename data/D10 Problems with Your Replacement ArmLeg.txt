D10 Problems with Your Replacement Arm/Leg
subtitle:
category: Lost Souls All
1. Gain sentience and trys to kill you in ur sleep
2. Your new arm is somehow smarter than you, and it won't shut up about it.
3. Every time u sleep it grows another finger/toe
4. It always goes a little to the left/right of where you want it to go
5. At least once a day it shuts off and ignores your commands for a full second.
6. The color is off. Or is it the length? No, it must be the girth. Wait, wasn't it wooden yesterday?
7. It's from the wrong side. i.e. left on the right or vice versa
8. It's wireless! Which means it sometimes copies nearby people's movements.
9. The material it's made from attracts beasts
10. You are a bit different every day after the replacement. One could almost say it's changing you, replacing your entire body. That can't be true... but then, comes The Voice...
