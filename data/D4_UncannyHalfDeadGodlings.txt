D4 Uncanny Half-Dead Godlings
subtitle:
category: Monsters & Miscreants
1. The one and a half headed basilisk: Momentarily resurrected to fight the user of a power to death whenever the die roll to use a power is on an angle so no one side is facing up but the user wants to manifest the power anyway.
2. An earth titan whose headlong fall and death spasms are the gradually dissipating aftershocks now felt by villagers across the plains.
3. Uisceach. The god of a once mighty river whose worshippers made it powerful through sacrifice, The Church of The Two Headed Basilisk killed its servants and it has grown weak with time. Craves the final breath of mortal lives.
4. The nameless. A neverborn godling, unwanted, aborted and cast down to the earth. Its shriveled fetus form whispers promises of power and wealth into the mind.
