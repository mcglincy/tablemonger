category: The Dying World
1. **Stinklord Üblkräkas the talking Shroom** A morbidly reeking mushroom the size of a large dog. (looks like Clathrus archeri, or Devil's Fingers) Might answer questions, offers insight into the mind of the enemy if the PCs would be so kind and come a bit closer please If close to them, spores will errupt, test Toughness DR16 or pass out and become infected by them, hearing their voice constantly and ultimately growing into a Üblkräkas twin. 
2. **Restless hangman** Dead, talking body hanging from one of the trees. Will seem friendly and can answer questions about what happened while he was hanging out there. He Is however cursed, and in the moment PCs turn back on him, he will try to hang the nearest PC to end his curse.
3. **Old Vespus** Wandering the forest in tattered robes. Bare muddy feet, darting eyes. Seems friendly enough, although... unfocused? In breaks in the conversation Vespus whispers under his breath, chuckles, nods to himself knowingly. Within his robes Vespus conceals a blood-caked rusty dagger... and if the voices tell him to, he'll use it.
4. **Man** He is a man. Just a normal guy. Just an average down to earth fella. Do not pay attention to his unusually large eyes or the bulge at the back of his head and definitely do not look at his second row of teeth. He has 50s he would like to give you!
5. **The Wailing Whisp** A withered mass of blackened, dried driftwood that vaguely resembles a child in the fetal position. It blends in seemlessly with its surroundings and has fused with the undergrowth. Roots stem from its body and reach far beneath the ground, connected to... Something. It knows too much and thus constantly laments it's existence-- though amidst it's mad ramblings scraps of useful information can occasionally be deciphered. Roll 1d2 upon encountering this creature, if the result is a 1 then their cries are indecipherable. If a 2 is rolled then some small piece of useful information on the party's quest shall be revealed. Regardless of the result, the creature will always rise from the underbrush to attack any who disturb its cries. Or perhaps it can be reasoned with? \n\n(Stats for the NPC, if you need them:)\n\nHP: 10\nMorale: -- (Will never flee or surrender)\nKeratinous bark skin -1d2\nThorn teeth -1d8, Jagged branches -1d6, Clubfists -1d4
6. **Chuck** Chuck has an established camp with a nice lean-to on the side of a clearing. He's talkative and knows a lot about all the things wrong with the forest. He sports a demure smile and will happily trade trinkets for sine fresh food he's cooked from forest animals he's hunted.\n\nChuck is a werewolf and will remember with intricate detail where PCs are going, and what they plan to do there. 
7. **Silas, the Sketchy Sage** You can find him in the middle of the forest, collecting herbs for some concoction. He is very friendly, will give you directions to the Tomb of the Dreadful Anteaters, but you look very tired, would you like a small sip of his homebrew potion of recovery? He also has a shroom ointment for that wound in your arm. Don’t worry, you don’t have to pay him or anything, he is very aware of how unwelcoming Sarkash can be. You might feel a bit dizzy after trying any of his stuff, and you might wake up in the middle of the forest several hours later with more scars in your torso than you remembered having, but hey, who can you blame: sages need a lot of weird ingredients for their elixirs, and your mom always told you not to trust a stranger. 
8. **Kalfa, the Wandering Chef** A portly woman, with rosy cheeks, and a welcoming smile.  She's wearing an apron and hat of strange design.  You find her small encampment along the side of the road in the direction of your destination.  A tent, cart, horse, some casks, and a campfire kitchen set up.  She beckons you over with a ladle, "My, you look famished! Don't worry, I have some hearty stew for you!"  It has been some time since you ate, so you oblige.  She asks questions about your adventures as you eat.  The meat in the stew is strange, but filling.  She also has information from a rumor for you regarding your current goal, if you would just stay for the evening.\n\nDR12 Presence to realize the stew is human flesh.\nDR14 Presence to find the casks in the cart are full of mismatched gear.\nDR14 Presence to figure out there are others hiding. In the tent, woods, and a cask or two. 1d2 Scum, 1d2 Berserkers are in hiding (adjust to party or replace with whatever scummy humanoids you wish).\n\nKalfa \nHP: 14   Morale: 9 (hiding enemies use hers)\nThick Human Leather: -1d2\nButcher's Cleaver: 1d6 (DR12 Toughness or become Infected)\nSpecial: Kalfa's Stew - DR12 Toughness for any that partook.  Any fails are stricken sick and fall to the ground in pain as the poison takes hold.
