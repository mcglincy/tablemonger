**D6 Corrupted Pets**
subtitle:
category: Monsters & Miscreants
1. An undead rat, sewn in half by a rather cruel child. The two sides are best friends.
2. Constantly barfing rabbit. It doesn't eat, it doesn't drink, but it follows you and barfs in a constant stream.
3. A bird. It's feathers are ragged and torn but still takes flight on its seven wings. It brings back each day glittering coins, metallic disks  and shiny plates but sometimes, it returns to you mementos from your nightmares and terrible past.
5. Monkey butler. A small monkey wearing the ragged and stained uniform of a butler. Eats only meat. Can be used each day for 1d4 menial tasks. Will go into a frenzy if left unfed.
6. A frog that sings hymns praising unholy gods.
