D10 Items You'd Find in a River of Tar

category: Treasures & Trinkets
1. An undead body, screaming due to its flesh instantly rotting when it touches the air. It craves death, but each of its cells lives individually, and it is unkillable unless it is reduced to atoms
2. **Ancient burial coin** A silver coin, one side shows an image of the skeletal boatman Charon. The reverse shows an eye which would be placed in a corpses eyes to supposedly pay for the passage to the afterlife.
3. **Horse** The preserved remains of a horse, once white and beautiful, now sticky and black. The name “Artax” floats in the back of your mind.
4. **The Warhammer "Kleb"** 1d8 damage, but as sticky as it is test strength after every successful hit to see if you can unstick it from your enemy. Stick it to 'em!
5. A message in a bottle written in an unknown language with a hastily scrawled map with some familiar landmarks.
6. The desiccated remainder of something between a childs foot and a goats hoof
7. A muck-covered glass jar filled with small, white, writhing worms that possess haggard human faces. If the jar is opened, thrown at something or otherwise destroyed roll 1d6 for the potential effects:\n1. The worms sing upon escaping their prison, a harrowing and distorted melody echoes all around before they burrow in to the ground.\n2. The worms are enraged. They burrow in to the skin of the nearest organic organism for 1d4 damage.\n3. They burst in to flames and screech at the top of their lungs upon being exposed to the atmosphere, withering away in to fine ash.\n4. They explode into yellowish-green discharge, tiny thrashing larvae can be seen frolicking amongst the substance.\n5. The worms rapidly cannibalise one another until only one remains. The last remaining worm will become large and bloated upon feasting on its brethren. It will attempt, in a shrill voice, to convince one of the players to eat it.\n6. The worms shed their skin and take the form of tiny white flies, chuckling jovially as they flutter off into the air. They laugh as though they know something you do not. 
8. **A flail** d8 damage, but once grabbed it's permanently stuck to the player, and they must roll disadvantage at doing anything that would ordinarily require hands.
9. **A rusted Zweihander** A hungry sword that requires a CR14 strengjr roll to remove from the current of tar. Does D12 damage. Constantly whispers to you about wanting to be buried into the heart of a troll,  If you indulge the wants of the sword it will immediately seep into the heart of the creature and resurrect it. Flip a coin to decide if it still wants to kill you.
10. **Gross Moses** You pull back the stained linen to reveal a fat baby with one eye bigger than the other, and a full set of sharpened teeth (d4 damage). The only sounds it makes are raspy growls.
