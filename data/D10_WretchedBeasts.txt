D10 Wretched Beasts
subtitle:
category: Monsters & Miscreants
1. **Tooth Golem** a vaguely humanoid mass of teeth, plaque, and ruddy gums. Stinks to high heaven.
2. **GIGA CATERPILLAR** - Long and Coiling, a Mass of Poisonous Black Furry Black Hair, it wriggles through the ghettos looking for small animals and homeless people to consume at Night.
3. **Giant Rust Roach** - HP:12, Armor:-d4, Metal-eating-mandibles:d8 + Special: attacks made by and against the rust roach involving metal weapons and armor rapidly degrade along with other proximate metals. Weapons take a -1 penalty to hit and damage, armor degrades a tier, and other worn metals break down after a minute.
4. **Wax Crawler** - A shambling, horrid smelling adipocere cast of a person, the insides long putrefied and turned into noxious soup. All details of the wax are muddied and smeared, except for the face, which is marked out in exquisite detail. 
5. **Neuron Bequeathor** - Vaguely humanoid, but too long, too lanky, too many chitinous tentacles on the back of it's skull. It slinks through the night, seeking out intelligent life. It wishes to share its thoughts with you. It's less interested in spirited discussion and more interested in injecting new grey matter via a hole in the skull.
6. **The Unchilded** - At a glance, indistinguishable from other tragedy-stricken wretched of these latter days. Indescribable grief has deformed their souls, and they single mindedly seek to hold their babes in their arms once more. 
7.  The **Insurance Salesman** will tail your party for days until the right opportunity presents itself. After the PCs survive a particularly costly and harrowing encounter, he will present himself and make incredibly tone deaf jokes about how the characters must feel really stupid for not having insurance for those injuries. Will then offer ludicrously overpriced monthly injury and death plans, smarming the whole time. Killing him will have no consequences other than attracting more insurance salesmen, each more tenacious and obnoxious than the last.
8. The **Skitterer**. A vaguely humanoid shape hangs on the edge of your periphery. It remains near a single individual for days, maddeningly out of sight- movement will occasionally be seen just on the edge of one's sight before the creature darts away. It is oddly lithe, and capable of folding itself in sickening ways to hide out of sight. Takes joy in knocking things over and causing other forms of small ruckus where they cannot be seen but they can otherwise be detected. It is technically possible to lock it in place- doing so requires immense planning.
9. **White Page Demon** Frustrated scholars and poets report seeing this entity appearing in the late hours, clouding their minds, distracting from their work, at times erasing the progress wrought from their quills at great effort. Its form is hazy and seems to repel the eye; even trying to comprehend it can prove mentally exhausting.
10. **Loose Bowels** - Some sort of intestinal horror, emerged from nearest sewer, now looking for snacks and somehow has teeth. HP 6, Morale -. Squishy gut-skin -d4. Leech-like fangs, d4 and will attach, automatically doing additional d4 per round until killed or removed with a DR14 strength check. Smells putrid, probably tastes worse. Infection?
