D6 Predatory Insects

category: Monsters & Miscreants
1. **Ceiling Dropion**. Hiding in a crack in the ceiling, leaving black foliage like dangly things hang out of it's hidey hole. As soon as someone is under it or touches its dangly bits, it will drop down with its huge mandibles first. 
2. **Facial Mites**. Those little bugs in your follicles aren't so little anymore, and that's not just a skin rash developed from dungeon diving. Presence DR16 to detect before it's too late. They crawl out of your face skin before trying to eat the scraps. D4 damage and permanent scars to the face. Strength DR4 to get them off before they start work on the few features still intact. They'll take out an eyeball on a failed strength check. 
3. **Eardevil**. A small and strange bug that coasts upon the winds. Make 1 DR 14 presence check or it crawls into your ear. After 1d4 days it has cocooned and now has influence over your mind.  You are now plagued with thoughts of shoving rotten fruits into your ear-maw, and killing every bird you see.
4. **Carpetpillar**. Yes, that rug has been moved recently. You may not notice how recently until you wake up having been rolled up in it, with its stinging cilia threads and knotty pincers working their way into your skin (1d4 poison damage each round). Strength check to work your way free before it's too late and your innards become part of the carpetpillar's "exotic" pattern splatted across its soft imitation-pile carapace.
5. **Scissor King**. A dog sized beetle that doesn’t hunt for prey so much as it runs it down. Flightless but deceptively fast; will catch man sized creatures between its two serrated jaws and snap them in half with enough force to crush rocks — or bones — to powder.
6. **Exoteric Hermit Crab**. A crab looking insect living inside fresh corpses. Don't think your buddy came back to life. In their stomach lives this crab, moving the body like a zombie, casting deadly scrolls and telling you about what's best in life.
