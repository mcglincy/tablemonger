1. **Bisketr and meatballs**: Take a Goblin or a creature of similar size and a sledgehammer. You need a big stone with a flat surface, like an altar for example. Put the live Goblin on it and mash it to pulp with the sledgehammer. Pound real hard and keep going until even the bones are pestled to a fine paste. Don't wash your hands and make bite sized balls out of the mush. Then let them sit for a day and check every now and then. It's ready to serve as soon as there is a large amount of worms and maggots. Add earthworms to taste.
2. **Bonelion Seepings**. Tightly bind a well-softened Bonelion thorax in a cloth sack, and hang for 14 days, tightening regularly. Collect the seepings in a wooden pail. Once clotted, serve on chunks of black bread.
3. **Tomato soup with eyeball-balls**
4. **Farmhand's delight**. Gruel from moldering grains left overnight in a half-filled chamberpot. Mix in fingernails and twice-digested corn for texture and top it off with a handful of potato peels. Heat before serving.
5. **Turnip 28's**: turnips marinated on fermented horse piss for 28 days. The turnip should be sliced like carpatio, as the taste is very peculiar and sour. The roots that grow during the process must be cut and made into a paste, to go with a side bread. Take care when eating, you might start worshiping turnips.
6. **Eggs 'n' Placenta**. A Breakfast Delight found in the (welcoming) hearths of Kergüs. Break three (fertilized) eggs over a skillet of uncooked placenta. Heat lightly and eat rare. Best served with a side of bonepaste, and sauerkraut (optional; sauerkraut is an acquired taste after all).
7. **Foie Gras Nourri Humain**. A cult that prays to a vile duck god from the days of yore performs a dark ritual of gorging a man to death on fowl whose flesh has begun to house maggots. This meat is then used to force feed the offspring of their master that are deemed in worth. The succulent meat is usually reserved for the leaders of the cult, however during different festivals throughout the dying world when they are in need of silver.
8. **Potato soup with beef and flower topping**. That's what the menu said. But it smells awefully like the goblin brain you made a stew out of a few days ago... and those are not flowers, that's just mold. And the beef is kind of... wait is that a human finger?
9. **Stringed slug**. The rare Töne slug might not be digestible, but its distinct flavor and mildly psychedelic properties makes it a sought after delicacy among Schleswig nobility. The proper way to serve it is attached to a long string of twined hair, so that after being swallowed, it can be easily retrieved by pulling it right back up. The same slug can be consumed hundreds of times, and can easily be shared with friends and family.
10. **Brussel Sprout Caramel Candy**. Serves 1. Take a handful of the Galgenbeck variant of Brussel sprouts (Brassica oleracea vomitus) and cook them in lye water (which takes of the natural sweetness). Boil ape hair with Glutaraldehyde until a thick paste forms. Skewer boiled brussel sprouts on rusty fork and coat them with caramel paste. Let dry for at least 24 hours.
