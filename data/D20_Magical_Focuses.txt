D20 Magical Focuses
1. **Dryadbone Staff**: A sturdy, if thorny, six-foot staff of petrified wood ending in a joint-like knob in resemblance to the end of a femur. Wielder can cast Hermetic Step and Bestial Speech with this Staff at DR10, even if they do not have the scrolls for such spells. Additionally, the Staff gives a +2 bonus to any check to cultivate plantlife.
2. **Wand of Phantasmal Steel**: The weight of the bluish metal shifts between feather and boulder at a moments notice. Wielder can cast Te-le-kin-esis and Lucy-Fires Levitation with this Wand at DR8, but only while the Wand is lightweight. While the Wand is heavy, it can be used as a d8 improvised weapon rather than a d4 one.
3. **Mushroom-clogged Violin**: Stinks of happier days and choked goodbyes, can no longer be played but the melancholy can be drawn upon. Wielder can cast Daemon of Capillaries and Grace for a Sinner scrolllessly at DR12, targets of these Powers have a 50% chance of suffering infection.
4. **Shrunken Monkey Head**: Manipulating its face features, its user can cast Tongue of Eris, Daemon of Capillaries or Eyelid Blinds the Mind once a day at DR 10 without scrolls. It turns to sawdust in d4 days.
5. **Cold Iron Rod**. Increases the Potency of Powers used against Fey creatures such as trolls, ogres, fairies and the like. Powers used against those creatures can be read at DR 8 but still requires scrolls and Power.
6. **Ruby Ring of Renewal**. When using a Power you have a 1 in 3 chance of gaining d2 Power
7. **Reading Glass of Misspelling**. This Focus lets you read Scroll easier DR 8. When you read a Scroll using this focus the GM chooses one letter from the name of the scroll to change. This may have a multitude of effects. Reading a Scroll incorrectly is sacrilege and you must roll an arcane catastrophe after the effects of the scroll take place. (Optional: The PC can choose the letter but rolls 2 catastrophes that take effect right after the scroll's effect takes place.)
8. **The Dusk Orb**. When wielding a Power, the orb will summon a Shivering Husk who will be the one to actually cast the spell. The Husk will gradually wither away and is dead before the next dawn. 
Shivering Husk—HP 3, Morale –, No armor, Unarmed d2. Skeletal, almost mindless creatures draped in dried paper-like skin. Does not understand the concepts of life, death, communication or consequence. Their only desire is to act, and will do so seemingly randomly until destroyed.
9. **Lich's tongue**. The dead but preserved tongue of a necromancer that still has residual theurgy of the undead sorcerer within, albeit it has contempt for it's current user. -2DR for casting but arcane catastrophe on a 2 or lower on d20
10. **Stone of Skipping**. You can channel Power into this stone to use it as a ranged weapon d4. The Stone will skip X times between enemies when X is how much Power was put into it. You may make a range attack roll against that many enemies in one turn never hitting the same one twice. You don't regain Powers for d4 days.
11. **Ominous scythe** Two handed farming sickle with an immaculate but minimalist design. It emanates an energy that makes you fear for your mortal soul. d8 damage when used as a weapon. The user of this focus always rolls the maximum amount for their amount of power usages. All spells cast through this focus become the spell Death.
12. **Goblin King's Phallus**. This Grotesque goblin girth is still full of pheromones. Expend a use of your powers to cause every nearby goblin to test morale. On failure the goblins will obey your commands for 24 hours. On success they will go into an unstoppable murder rage against you.
13. **Blackest Powder**: Concentrating on this dose of black powder hard enough (DR12 Presence) will explode something in the area. The person to the left of the player decides what explodes.
14. **Güffos' Chalky Turd**: Coprolite used by a heretic to study holy texts. As a focus gives -2DR for casting unclean scrolls. As chalk casts a random sacred scroll power (4 uses before pulverizing in a stinky cloud).
15. **Freak Leash**: Its handling demon grants one automatic unclean scroll power once a day but its wearer will be forced to kill a marked victim. If they don't, they will be throttled to death.
16. **Doom Monkey's Paw**. Whenever a wish is asked of this evil monkey paw by it's wielder, it will manifest a spell (which one is determined by the DM) and try to carry out the wish. Be careful what you wish for, has 5 uses.
17. **Two Headed Coin**. A gold coin depicting either basilisk on each side.  When casting a spell rather than roll a d20, you can instead flip this coin. If the result is SHE, treat it as rolling a 1 on the d20. If the result is HE, then treat it as rolling a 20 on the d20.
18. **Eyes of Newt**. This bag of salted consecrated mustard seeds can be spread around in a circle to ward off undead and spirits, they must test Morale +4 to pass by the barrier. The barrier visibly drains your spirit and remains as many rounds as you have Power to which it then starts draining your health d2 per round. It's also a nice salty snack. Has d4 uses.
19. **Rabbit's Foot**. Channeling 2 power into the foot will give you an automatic Crit for your next roll, but the next ally's roll is a Fumble. The luck has to come from some where. This is effect is oddly immune to Omens...
20. **Flayed Raven**. Using this grim focus allows you to replace any Power's effect with that of an Omen. A fumble kills a random nearby creature, however.
