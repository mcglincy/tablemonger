D6 Boss Monsters
1. **The Reassembled**. An anatomically incorrect variety of Frankenstein's monster. Reassembled from the parts of many corpses. An abstraction of human limbs where his reattached to his crotch. His guts and intestines are filled with rancid waste and one of his main attacks consists of pissing acid out of his mouth while gargling curses at his victims. The Reassembled is seeking revenge towards the living that cursed him to live like this and constantly slurs and curses. Imagine that his lungs are connected with intestines.  \n\n**HP** 30\n\n**Attacks** (D4): 1) Rancid Piss Spew: 1D4 Per round until healed by salva. 2) The Grasp of Hundred limbs: 1D6. 3) The Human Wrecking Ball (rolls or throws itself onto it's enemies) 1D8. 4)  Cursed by Bowels (PCs must beat a DR13 of toughness to avoid being sickened by the wretched song of the digestive system, or become passified for d4 rounds.)
2. **Living Smoke**. Some witches get burned, and others have tried to resurrect their ashes with living water. The result is a creature made of smoke, ready to feast on any inquisitor or holy man in town but also on those peasants who laughed while she was burning. She sucks all knowledge out of her victims, when they inhale. After being filled with enough knowledge, she can be either captured by a spell, or she disperses into thin air.*\n\n**HP** 25 **Morale** – **Thick smoke** -d8 damage **Size** 10ft x 10ft\n**Specials:**\n**Inhale:** If you are within the Living Smoke radius, roll toughness 12 or inhale the smoke, leaving you with complete amnesia. For every creature that is within the Living Smoke radius, the smoke loses 2 HP per round.\n**Whispers of Madness:** The Living Smoke whispers spread to all people around her. Make a DC12 presence test or move 10ft back. Those standing within the smoke cannot move.\n**Magic vulnerability:** The Living Smoke is vulnerable to magic spells and they have greater effect on her (for damage spells, count as crit). If the Living Smoke is between 1 HP and 6 HP, she can be captured, with her knowledge, into an item. You’ll need to right spell to do that though. If the living Smoke reaches 0 hp, she disperses into the air. Often accompanied by a few hags or witches, and found in towns. \nAn item filled with Living Smoke Knowledge will sell for at least 150 silver.
3. **1001 goblins**. One of them has a crown and deals extra damage. If you kill the one with the crown another goblin will put it on. You can only lose.
4. **Arch-Tormentor Kristian Tyrann**.\n Nechrubel's touch is insidious and deep, able to infect the minds of even the most devout servant of the Twin-Headed Basilisks. It is said there is man so evil, Nechrubel himself calls him friend. Leading the sinister Executioners of Nechrubel, Kristian Tyrann was once beloved by the Church of Galgenbeck. One day, shipfuls of starving folk from the world beyond the Endless Sea came to Galgenbeck for refuge. Kristian Tyrann took almost one-hundred folk in and gave them a bargain - if they worked constructing a tower, he would allow them to stay in shelter and food.\n\n The tower took fourteen years to construct, during which time he drew his plans with his engineers. The tower was seven stories, among the highest outside Galgenbeck, and was intended as a forge and center of research for mighty tools to aid Galgenbeck's dominion. When the tower was constructed, Tyrann ushered his workers inside and gave them a sermon.\n\n When they emerged, they rallied a blood tax - five victims for every man, woman, and child who died working on the tower. Over a hundred people were dragged into the tower. The year of horrible research that proceeded is spoken of only in the harshest whisper, the deepest privacy. Kristian Tyrann created the Executioners and bound them to his will. He invented the thirteen suffering engines, which draw power from the victim inside and slay countless men. He wrote the twisted **Alchemic Pain Manual**, a treatise on the art of suffering.\n\n When Galgenbeck cast him out, killed his following, and destroyed his home, Nechrubel was swift to pick him back up. His research is elsewhere now, fortified beyond even Galgenbeck's power to destroy. He improves on his projects, suffused with the will of Nechrubel. And he creates new nightmares every day, full of joy at his boundless creativity that pleases even Nechrubel.\n\n Kristian Tyrann has 1 HP, Morale 6, No armor, and a small sharp tool 1d4 HP. ***He is only a man.***
5. **Bethalud the last guardian**. First boss from my almost done dungeon. Missing both eyes and having just empty eye sockets. Old as balls. Tasked with guarding the lower level of the ossuary. Will not let anyone to the lower levels. And will not part with his cane willingly. Wears a red cap.\n\nLast of the monks. Extremely pleased by the company, says that there is no one else to talk to but dust and shadows anymore.\n\n **HP** 4, **Morale** -, **No armor** \n∙ **Cane** 1d4+number of miseries.\n∙ **Fast.** Always wins initiative\n∙ **Life everlasting.** If not killed with one blow, will not lose hp.\n∙ **Death everlasting.** If killed and HP is not -3 or less, will transform into the `Beast That Lurks in the Dark`. The cane is lodged into his flesh.\n\n**Beast that lurks in the dark**\nDeformed flesh and limbs. Otherworldly guttural growls. Feathers and hair protrude from decaying skin. Mind set to torment.  \n\n**HP** 35, **Morale** -, no armor \n∙ **Putrid Claws** 1d8\n∙ **Stomp.** Test AGILITY DR 12 to get out of the way or take 2d6 damage.\n∙ **Consume.** At or below 7 hp tries to eat a PC. Test STRENGTH DR 12 or get eaten and die. Beast heals to full hp.
6. **Mock Basilisk**.\n Some say it's no more than an insane and mutated noble, others say it's a prophet of the twin-headed basilisk. The Mock Basilisk is in reality a bit of both.\n\n Horribly disfigured, a two-headed human noble carried around in a palanquin held up by 4 zealous cultists. Wherever he goes, he spews pure madness from his mouth.\n\n **HP** 7, **Morale** -, Light Armour.\n\n **Faithful Servants**: The wretched seer is protected by 4 zealous cultists. If the Mock Basilisk ever takes a hit and there are cultists still alive, they may intervene and take the damage instead. They have HP 5 and attack with swords (D6 damage).\n\n **Unintelligible Preaching**: There is a constant flow of noise from one of the two heads. All that can hear the Mock Basilisk make tests to use powers at DR 16.\n\n **Lazy**: When in the palanquin without guards, the Mock Basilisk is little more than a wretch. One may even take pity on the poor creature. DR 10 to attack the prophet when the 4 cultists are killed.
