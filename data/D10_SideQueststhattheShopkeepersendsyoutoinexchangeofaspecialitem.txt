D10 Side-quests That the Shopkeeper Sends You To, in Exchange for a Special Item
1. The left ear of five different creatures.
2. An effigy of She that he sold to someone last week who, he heard, was now awaiting inhumation at the East Temple Yard.
3. They want *[dramatic pause]* a gull that screams the name of their son. From Allains. From the castle. Catch the gull.
4. There is a shopkeeper doppelganger they want to be rid of. The other shopkeeper offers the same quest. Any other person living in this area insists the two are twins.
5. Slay a particularly intelligent Howler Bear deep in Sarkash. The Shopkeep is rather bored and will follow the party from afar in a merchant wagon, hoping to catch the chaos that will ensue. He’ll use the Howler Bear’s voice box to craft what can only be described as a screambox that screeches when disturbed.
6. Find the goblin who stabbed his son before the curse overcomes him. Succeed and get the map to the shopkeep family’s secret stash of silver (was going to be the son’s college fund).
7. Get the receipt of Lord Baxter before he wants to trade in his 'silver' jewels. Without a receipt, he cannot prove his buy. You get a 'silver' ring in return from the shopkeeper.
8. A body part taken from each of the shopkeeper's main business competitors. "Make sure they get the message."
9. The shop is cursed and by crossing the threshold you are now bound as shopkeeper until the apocalypse. Avoid your fate by pouring a tankard of blood freely given from a firstborn on the counter before the moon rises.
10. Four Zebra Hooves, only issue is that they are endangered and under the protection of a band of Savannah druids. The Hooves make a magic stew to restore those dying of old age.
