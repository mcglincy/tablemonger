D8 Galgenbeck Souvenirs That You Shouldn't Have Bought

category: The Dying World
1. **The Galgen-noose** Sturdy piece of rope, makes you want to strangle someone in their sleep. 
2. **Goblin Dolls** A handcrafted doll, made with care, from the finest authentic goblin skins available. May still have the goblin curse. Who can say for sure. 
3. **Royal's Crown** Galgenbeck has no kings or queens but it is rumored that they may have at some point. Whether these rumors are true or not the crown holds the soul of a ancient royal who is desperate to talk to anyone, very paranoid, fearful of you leaving it, and rambles nonsense.
4. **Self-flagellating Whip** Perfect for the ascetic on the go, its barbs are sharp and cause weeping injuries. But you feel greater shame and pain whenever you put it down ... so you've done so less and less frequently ever since you purchased it.
5. **Heretic's Charcoal** With the Inquisition burning heretics in their 100s there's no shortage of this fleshy coal-like substance on the souvenir stalls that line the pyre squares. Can be used to write or burn, but more often another thought crosses the minds of the starving scum.
6. **Handbell of Shame** A small bell that when rung makes any listeners be internally confronted with their greatest shame.
7. **Cast iron demon horn replica** Used by the rich to drink from. At least you think so. Drinking from the horn gives you 30 minutes of DR-4 on Strength and Toughness rolls. However, when the 30 minutes have passed, you lose 1d4 hit points as your life is drained by Bergharuth, the demon prince.
8. **Stone Gargoyle’s Ear** It’s ugly, but feels lucky. Your companions shall suffer a little bit more than you.
