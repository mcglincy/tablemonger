D10 (Un)fortunate Survivors of Arcane Mishaps and Magical Malevolence

category: Monsters & Miscreants
1. **Kargaroth**: he fades in and out of existence. He can sometimes be confused with a ghost and consequentially attacked. The poor guy can only sometimes interact with physical world, and when he fades out drop anything he's handling and only his faint voice could be heard.
2. The personality and memories of **Bulgaur the priest**. Held delicately as a mist between two sculpted silver hands. The cloud sparks brief colours and shapes of memory. It can be inhaled to heal 1d4+1 hp, but in doing so the personality and memories are destroyed. Bulgaur's body is in a slum being kept alive by other devotees.
3. A **nameless wanderer**, wrapped in rags, whose identity was burned away. Their personality is very bland, and their conversation boring. The only noteworthy thing about them is the smell of something burning which follows them. If the rags are unraveled, an entirely unidentifiable mass of charred meat spills out.
4. A **hapless toad** who got caught in an alchemy lab explosion and swapped body's with the alchemist involved. Unfortunately the alchemist was not accustom to his newfound toad form and quickly was devoured by nearby rats. The toad isn't doing much better and still hasn't figured out how to talk yet, but he's sort of got walking down!
5. **Btaanbin the Unstitched**. His efforts to unwind the inexorable momentum of progress only shattered his own connection to time. He can manifest only as disjointed moments in time—appearing randomly as a child, old man, or adult. Sometimes more than one instance of him appear at the same time, scrupulously trying to avoid noticing each other, not always succeeding.
6. **Golden statue of Dinh**. Dinh Al-Hazim was an alchemist pursuing the ultimate task - transmutation of objects to gold, but succeeded in transmuting himself. The gold was melted down into coins by his apprentice and cursed with Dinh's sentience and malignant power. Adventurers who become owners of such coins hear suggestions of steps in evil spells whispered to them like the call of the void, causing them insomnia until the steps are completed.
7. **Phleysh**. Confined to a basin full of frigid water ever since her experimentations inverted her skin and organs. She created the Clay Man to assist her research, but now this marvel of magic is reduced to traveling further and further in search of ice to keep her body from deteriorating further.
8. **Vials of Myrnnorh's elixir** can be found for sale in the itinerant bazaars of Galgenbeck, ferried from the forest of Sarkash. The two dose glass vials are filled with the blood of Myrnnorh, a druid caged and milked for their blood's restorative powers after they fell head-first into a decoction of their own making. Myrnnorh is incredibly old and misshapen, weak from centuries of drainage and unable to remember the recipe for the decoction she fell into. A Myrnnorh's elixir restores 1d4 health per dose.
9. In the cold winter nights, wanderers travelling toward Alliàns could spot a marvelous show in the sky. When the moonless night is at his darkest hour, the sky is sometimes lightened by a million lights, forming the illusion of a veil, moving in the icing wind. It's all what's left of **an ancient wizard**, that is rumored wanted to find the secret behind the False Dawn sacred scroll. It seems that Nechrubel punished his arrogance and made an example of him, a warning for all the people: magic should not be taken lightly.
10. **Fish of the lake**. Once a thriving village called Mulgra-took who exported mainly fish, a dreaming giant took umbridge and turned the tides upon them, washing out their village with rancid lakewater. Each person became a gulping, foot-long human-faced carp. They must come to the surface to breathe, and a rival village has begun harvesting their neighbours for fun and profit, despite their pleas for mercy.
