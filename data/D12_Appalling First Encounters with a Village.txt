D12 Appalling First Encounters with a Village
1. They kidnap a random PC to sacrifice to their cult.
2. You arrive in the middle of a massive religous ritual. The ceremony is unique to this town and kinda cultish... they'd want you in, but won't let you out.
3. People are throwing shitbuckets from  second story windows. A passerby is hit. As are those who laugh.
4. Everyone in the village is a husband. Father. Priest. They all have the same clothes and haircut. There are no women or children in sight.
5. Everything smells wrong. Not bad, just not as what it should smell like. Every occupant of the town is blinking at the same time.
6. Everyone is enthused about a bloated buffoon who promises to “Make the Dying Lands Great Again” by building a wall and making Grift pay for it.
7. The villagers are all deathly pale and malnourished looking. They move with extreme lethargy when in eyesight, but when you turn your head, you can hear quick footsteps and whispers
8. It becomes obvious that *something* else is controlling the villagers' actions in a painfully bad imitation of mortal behavior. They seem oblivious or uncaring if anyone notices or points this out.
9. The villagers have gathered pots, pans, stones, and anything else they can find into a ring and are frenetically pounding on them in a drum circle. They greet you effusively and bid you dance in the middle of the ring. It is impossible to hear anyone say anything.
10. The town drunk immediately projectile vomits blood on one of the PCs, then keels over dead. Test Toughness.
11. The Priest welcome PCs. The whole town offers food, clean clothes and warm beds. They will try to sacrifice PCs to a forgotten god at midnight.
12. Every villager’s reaction seems slightly delayed and out of sync. The delay grows worse over time. It applies to objects and creatures as well.
