D4 Strange Alcoholic Beverages

category: The Dying World
1. **Piss Wine**: A bright yellow wine which tastes of soured socks and piss. But after drinking two of these beverages the average human is blackout drunk.
2. **Ambrosia** Tastes like the sweetest most exotic fruits.
3. **Goblin Goblet**. It's a party thing, you take a freshly cut goblin head, let it bleed out a little, place it upside down, plug nostrils. Then pour beverage or left overs of choice in the neck opening until full. Let it sit for a week. Stab out an eye and poke the opening until the mix pours out. Enjoy!
4. **Anthelia's Ice** A liquor that freezeburns your throat.
