D4 Creatures That Might Kill You in the Night in the Woods of Sarkash
1. **Förfrysning**. DR-2 to hit due to its size. Fiery and crushing attacks have their crit range increased by three—e.g., the normal crit range of 20 becomes 17–20. **HP** 32. **Morale** special. **Rime hide** -d6 + special. **Mauling** 2d6+1. **Frosty bite** 2d6 + special. **Special (rime hide)** If armor's tier is reduced, it reforms to -d6 by the next stalking. **Special (frosty bite)** As below, test Toughness DR14 or lose d2 HP.
2. **Creeping Copse**. This small clearing in a ring of bushes and trees suggests a decent chance at overnight safety, as the thick brush and low-hanging branches can both hide you and deter any but the hungriest predators. Unfortunately, the leaves and straw on the ground hide the gnarled roots that trap your limbs and the mouth that will consume you once you're seated or lying on the ground. In its branches are pseudo-birds that warble not-quite-authentic calls to attract its prey. HP 45 Morale -- Movement -- Terrified of fire and will free a trapped victim if threatened with flame.
3. **TÖRNEBIRDS**. These mostly silent kestrel-sized birds attack anything that comes close to their nest. They hunt for meat at night, preferring to spear creatures' eyes and take them back to their nests.\n\n1d4 birds per nest\n\n HP 2 Morale-- No armor -- DR 16 to hit due to speed and size. Strafe -- 1d2 dmg as birds fly close, brushing their barbed, thorny feathers against their target. Special -- Piercing Note: 1d4+1 dmg -- 1 in 8 chance törnebirds dive directly at a target stabbing with their long barbed beak, emitting a sustained trilling note as they do. 3 in 6 chance it breaks its neck on impact. Once embedded, its barbed beak prevents a törnebird from slipping out of a target. Living törnebirds scratch and batter at a person for 1d2 damage for 1d4 rounds until they eventually drown in the target's blood. Target takes 1d4 dagage of tearing damage removing a beak from their body.\n\nTheir nests are surprisingly smooth and make very comfortable (and fashionable in certain circles) hats, though they smell like birdshit.\n\nRaw törnebird eggs heal 1d3 hp of damage if eaten (roll 1d4 -- on a four, PC contracts Salmonella poisoning instead). Cooked, they're worthless and are too small to provide any reasonable sustenance shy of a dozen.
4. **Gölo Gölo**. A muscular and smelly beast. It’s akin to a bear, or... dog, maybe more like a large weasel. No matter what beast it bears resemblance to, it’s still a monstrous predator. It’s capable of unmaking almost anything larger than itself, beast and man alike. (Will make stat block soon, on my break at work lol)
