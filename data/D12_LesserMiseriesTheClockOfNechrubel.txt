D12 Lesser Miseries: The Clock of Nechrubel
1. The Clock Strikes **One** Night has just begun, but it portends an end. The eyes grow restless in their skulls and shalt reclaim their domain.
2. The Clock Strikes **Two*** Lo, the Clock has tolled again and midnight inches closer. The Shroud of Dread shall fall upon you, darkening visions and crushing dreams.
3. The Clock Strikes **Three*** The flesh grows weary at its work, and itches to end its labors, sloughing unto rest eternal.
4. The Clock Strikes **Four** Upon this fourth chime, heads become a hell.  The slumber of the world becomes disturbed and intruded upon.
5. The Clock Strikes **Five** Twilight vomits forth legions of lion-headed insects to sting and bite. The blood-swollen marks shall fester with maggots in the image of their progenitors.
6. The clock strikes **Six** A burning light flashes, blindingly bright. The pallid skin of the living soon-to-be dead bubbles and blisters.
7. The Clock Strikes **Seven** All are cursed to have one shoe tied a little bit tighter than the other.
8. The clock Strikes **Eight** And all the creatures are suddenly filled, towards each other, with fury and hate.
9. The clock Strikes **Nine** No one is able to distinguish those who are dead from those who are alive
10. The clock Strikes **Ten** All toes fall off and burrow into the ground.
11. The clock Strikes **Eleven**, silence strangles the environment - For time itself pities and mutely mourns the past, and present, for what the future holds at the strike of Twelve.
12. **Midnight** War blossoms in pillars of primordial fire. Ephemeral fungus scars the firmament. The air itself is poison, striking all with agonized wastingâ€”death would be mercy.
