D20 More Arcane Catastrophes
subtitle:
category: Powers & Weirdness
1. **Handyman**. Your feet become hands, and your head is replaced by a hand with a sock and button eyes. You can still see, but you are too goofy to take seriously +6 DR to all social interactions.
2. **Spelldust Addiction**, You get addicted to the smell of spelldust hanging in the air after a Power gets used. Because of that you feel a compulsory need to use Powers, any Power really, at the beginning of each combat and d10 hours after your last use. You can try to resist that urge by passing a DR14 Toughness test but it will never fully go away.
3. **The Fee of Flesh**. Your skin cracks, splinters, and is consumed in a violent a conflagration. Your armor melts into a heap of slag at your feet. Your skin never recovers and you have a permanent smell of cooked sausages about you.
4. **Curse of the Cephalophore**. Your neck vanishes as if it never existed. Due to the strange magic, you are still alive but things are much more difficult as you must now carry your head with you. You still must eat and drink water, but if your head is ever taken good luck being reunited with your body.
5. **Butterfingers**. your fingers constantly exude a slippery, foul smelling, half solid grease from their pores. The wax leaves greasy stains on anything it comes into contact with, and is extremely hard to scrub off. Every time you need to do something involving handling an object carefully there is a 1-in-6 chance of dropping it. This check is only made during the worst possible moments of such tasks.
6. **Waist of Wonder**. Due to magical alteration, every time you eat, something odd appears from your mid-line: 1. gust of wind 2. stinking cloud 3. lightning bolt 4. cloud of butterflies 5. shimmering light 6. exude a creature (DM's choice)
7. **Cold Chill of the Centipede**: The arcane properties seem to channel into yourself. You don't feel... particularly wrong, but a scittering travels your spine and courses your veins-- a general malaise and deathly cold that reemerges when you think you see something crawling under your skin. When resting, roll 1d2 to subtract from health gained. Upon your inevitable death, your "guests" are expelled from your body through any orifice they can burrow.
8. **Blinding Power**. the scroll's words bind themselves to your soul, giving you access to the scroll's powers an additional 1d4 times per day, however in doing so the power blinds you. You will never read another scroll again and your Agility (if above 0) is lowered to 0 permanently.
9. **Demon's Head**. Nothing special, you just have a pustulated demon's head in place of your own. Most speech comes out sounding like, "SQUARF SQUARF NEE-YAKK SQUARF!!!"
10. **PIRANHA**. Instead of your chosen spell, you conjure a school of ravenous flesh eating, gravity defying fish (hp1, 2d6 fish in total). The target of the spell is immediately engulfed by the hungry monsters and takes 2dX damage and after the attack have their armor completely destroyed. After the target is devoured, they turn on you. (X is the highest matching dice to the number of fish in the school, round up if it's an odd number)
11. **Gut Full Of Glass**. You feel a strange rumble from inside yourself and the next moment it's gone. The next time you would have a bowl movement (camping, visiting an Inn, etc) Roll Toughness DR20. If you fail, roll (20 - your toughness roll)d4
12. **Black Starred Revelation**: As you read the scroll and cast your spell, the words alter and shift, they spread from the paper and onto your skin, crawling up your arm and into your eyes. These sights taint your vision and corrupt your mind. You are no prophet. You are no seer. But your mind and vision is trapped in the days of apocalypse to come. You can no longer see the world you live in-- but the ruins of it in the coming age.
13. **Black Celebration**. You accidentally open a minute portal to the nether realm, directly above your head. The area about you is permanently filled by an uncanny darkness (30' radius), impenetrable to all sight, including your own. Wherever you go, the darkness follows... making it a real pain in the ass to find the bathroom, among other things.
14. **Not what you wanted**. You immediately cast Death instead of your intended spell
15. **Wretched Wally** appears next to you with a soft thump. He is a being made of felt and eyes made of buttons. He knows your secrets. Yes, even that one. He shares your secrets with anyone who will listen. Sharing is caring. Don’t hurt Wally, it wouldn’t be very nice.
16. **Vermin**. You are haunted and hunted by the filth of the earth. Every bed crawling with fleas and bedbugs, rats haunting your every step, biting flies cloud your vision.
17. **Dryad Blood**. Your skin slowly turns to bark as you grow small sickly sprouts. Your new tree-like physiology gives you a permanent d2 armor on top of what you are wearing, however now all health regained through non magical means is reduced by half and you are weak to fire.
18. **Oops**. Scroll crumbles to dust, as do d6 of your fingers.
19. **An Unwelcomed Guest**. The target of your spell is engulfed in darkness and forms into a lich from another realm, it is hungry for death. If you were casting the spell on yourself or a companion: you find yourself in a realm of unending pain and death. Surrounded by colossal blood drenched worms and moist meaty skeletons, leaving your companions to deal with the lich. Don't bother trying to fight or reason with the otherworld residents of this realm, as their numbers are infinite and they only care to sedate their unending hunger.
20. **Replace your teeth** with grasping, bony hands. They constantly pinch and poke your tongue and cheeks, and will snap loudly in response to food they find satisfactory. It is extremely difficult to vocalize, and all presence checks to do with talking are made at Dr 16.
