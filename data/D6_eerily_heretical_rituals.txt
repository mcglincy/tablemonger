D6 Eerily Heretical Rituals
1. Make an upside down cross effigy with your fallen ally’s corpse. Roll presence to see if it pleases the gods. If they’re pleased, causes your next ally to be slightly less likely to die (+1 to a random stat for the next PC who joins the party)
2. Behead your two worst enemies, and sport their skulls atop your hands like puppets. Ritualistic comedy ensues as--before the gods--you make the heads admit and argue their greatest failures. "I'm the devil!" "No, I'm the devil!" etc.
3. On a moonless night gouge out one of your eyes. You must not make any noise while doing this (DR 18, adjusted by GM for any preparations made in advance like drinking black grog or going into a trance). If successful, you can see lies as streaked stains on reality.
4. Speak a word; yes, any word. It is not the word that matters, but the intent. Next, take a life; yes, any life. It is not the life that matters, but the intent. Finally, make a wish; yes, any wish. It will be granted, but not in a way you expect.
5. Take the 3 innocent pure lives and 3 filthy and impure lives, and pile the corpses. This is an invitation for Varash, the ungod of brutality and slaughter, to come and be at your command for 12 hours. At the end of that time, Varash takes your life too.
6. Remove the tongues of your living mother and father, and end their lives with iron. When the moon rises you can speak all dead languages, and the dead heed your words. When the next moon rises your words betray you in a tongue you do not understand.
