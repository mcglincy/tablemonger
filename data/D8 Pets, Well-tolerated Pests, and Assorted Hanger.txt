D8 Pets, Well-tolerated Pests, and Assorted Hangers On
1. **Abigail** This friendly white and black dog charms everyone she meets. Add 2 to the reaction roll on meeting NPCs unless they are truly heartless. Useless in a fight.
2. **Blood-fat ticks.** A cluster of ticks have taken up residence on you. They drain d2 hp worth of blood every day. On any given day, d4 ticks are ripe for the plucking. Thrown at an enemy, they splatter their contents—the enemy must roll Toughness DR16 or be incapacitated for 1d6 rounds with nausea. The power of blood magic means this works on both the dead and the living. You can also drain a ripe tick to get back 1HP.
3. **Snake The Conspirator. ** The talking snake that hangs around your neck. It says smart things and versed in religion. Every day it needs to be fed with apples. If you outwit a snake (roleplay or Presence DR 16), it will turn into hot edgy demon (for d4 hours) that can't be visible to everyone except you and true believers, but can interact with material world.
4. **Her Royal Highness** In these latter days, the vultures grow ostentatious, yet this one must be a queen among them, brilliantly festooned with the trophies of hundreds of cadavers. She must have taken a liking to you, as she only demands a tithe of one body per day from you. Once per day, test Presence DR14 to have her command the dead to act in your favor. It is said that carrion-eaters are emissaries of Nechrubel; perhaps if you gift her enough she will whisper some of the Dark God’s secrets to you.
5. **The innkeeper's daughter**. Sooner or later you will visit a tavern. Who would have thought that yandere would fall in love with you? She's stalking you with a kitchen knife (d6 damage) and attack everyone (from an ambush) who she considered dangerous. And every female person. While she's stalking you, you gain +4 HP after rest with sleep if you alone and d4 rations that she's cooked every day. Each day you must roll d4 Scum. It's her father's mercs.
6. **Ghost of your first victim**. It bothers you by alarming screams when you sleep or when you try to think. Rolls for Presence gain +2 to DR and -2 to HP when rest with sleeping. It's very offended, often cries. You can banish these soul if you save someone's live.
7. **Child of Mud**. No one knows if this is just an actual child that plays in the mud, or is some sort of mud spirit that crawled forth from some muddy slop in a swamp.  Either way, they act childish by tossing mudballs at people.  +2 to reaction if any PC has muddy clothing, -2 if they're all clean.  Helps on 9-12 reaction roll.  Can distract enemies, giving PCs a +2 to Attack and Defense rolls. **HP** 8  **Mudskin** -d2  **Mudball** d2, plus distraction  **Special** Requires any PC to wear muddy clothing every night.
8. **Sinclair the unwise.** A, tall, gaunt, scholarly looking gentlemen with a hoarse voice and crackled skin. This reserved and timid person will assist in fights only if you succeed Presence check of DR 14. He does all his Attacks and Defense with a DR of 14, and has a Moral of 5 and 6 HP. If he takes any damage, roll Moral and on a failure he runs away, only to return when the fight is over. When asked for his opinion or advice he will **Always give the worst Answer**.
