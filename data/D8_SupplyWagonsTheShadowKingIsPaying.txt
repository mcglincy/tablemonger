D8 Supply Wagons the Shadow King is Paying to Have Escorted. 
subtitle: I wonder what's inside...
category: Plots, Portents, and Lies
1. Rations to a needy village. The boxes seem to writhe and the smell from them grows more and more noxious. Upon inspection the meat seems to somehow be rotting yet moving, looks like the Shadow King solved his recent undead problem.
2. a box of tainted luxury: opium laced with powdered glass, medicine that causes sterility, wine mixed with lead sugars. it seems the Shadow King seeks to feed a sadistic side to himself, to seize some control in these dying days.
3. Corpses. The bodies have obviously seen plentiful damage- they are unrecognizable now, with their faces damaged beyond imagination. Something truly diabolical is afoot.
4. Upon opening the box, a set of stairs is revealed, winding down, downâ€¦
5. cloth and wine, and if the party looks closer... a little box. In that crooked looking box you find a bit of black silk with red embroidery (some symbols), inside it, a nail, bit old looking. The nail calls out to be stuck into flesh, either your own or one of the other party members. When that nail pierces your meat, you grow d4 horns on random places on your head, you can now use a ram attack and even do d4x(number of horns) piercing damage in one headbutt. Great! But ordinary people fear you or want to see you beheaded!
6. A caravan of a travelling circus. Acrobats, clowns, troubadours, captured monsters, strongmen, master archers; a seemingly endless parade of joy and fun. There does seem to be a stench of rot, decay and maggot slime coming from the wagons though...
7. The heart of a woman who claimed to be his daughter. It is still beating.
8. It's empty? Then why the heavy security? Where are we going again?
