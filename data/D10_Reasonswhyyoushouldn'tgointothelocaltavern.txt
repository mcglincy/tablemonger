D10 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Go into the Local Tavern
1. The ale is gone.
2. Inside, a local priest of the Cretin order (at least he says so) is muttering the words of HIM and blesses everyone to withstand the end of the world. 100 silver to participate in the blessing, that involves a bath of sheeps blood and crimson flowers, wearing thorns around your wrist for a day (roll 1d4, on a 1 you get infected) and summoning a \"lesser\" \"demon\" to kill. The demon might be you, and the blessing has no effect whatsoever.
3. It's on fire and has been for some time.
4. It's pitch-black inside and no light is allowed.
5. It associates itself with some horse named Bartholomew.
6. The mead there is heady and sweet, irresistible to your suddenly parched throat. Roll a d4: 1) You wake to shouts and jeers, weapons nailed to your hands (see Flails Akimbo). 2) Time passes in a particularly sloppy, smeared fashion. After d4 hours you find yourself in a jagged cave, naked and alone. 3) You fool! That was Red Harvald's mead and now he's (not) pissed. 4) The tavern keep's monkeys rob you blind
7. It's a mimic disguising as tavern.
8. It is run by Pale Ones serving gooey discoloured "beer".
9. What tavern....what are you talking about? There never was a tavern.
10. It's Wretched Royalty night. All drinks are twice as much.
