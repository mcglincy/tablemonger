D10 Pieces of Tosh (treasure) One Might Find Washed into a Sewer
subtitle:
category: Treasures & Trinkets
1. A full pig stuffed with silvers. Its skin is dense and hard to cut through. Squeeze or push on its bloated stomach to cough up 2d20 coins.
2. A skeletal hand with a grimy jewel permanently attached to it. Whoever lays eyes on it is compelled to keep it for themselves else the whispers get louder and louder.
3. An excrement-covered jeweled dagger of excellent make but no matter how hard it is rinsed and scrubbed, the smell can never be removed
4. Josilfa Migol's turds. Worth millions to the faithful. 
5. The sparkling silver excrement of some mystical sewer-dwelling ne'er-do-well. It smells vaguely of rosemary (sells for 25 coins). 
6. A poisonous truffle that only the unclean can distinguish from a glorified turd. It can be used to manufacture arrows that make the victim lose their shit. Literally.
7. A beautifully-stitched, miniature bejewelled waistcoat. Worth at least 50 silver, if you can catch the greasy sewer rat that has somehow donned it. 
8. A compendium of excrement shape/color combinations and what they mean in reference to their producer, an astrology of sorts.
9. A corpse, has 2d10*10 silver on it and a note relating in some way to a party member
10. An inexplicably clean cutlery set.
