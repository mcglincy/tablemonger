The fourth misery turns your tongue into the prophetic tongue of the basilisk (learn one random sacred/unclean power). The fifth misery will make you increase in size, not to that of a basilisk, but pretty big (+1 strength). The sixth misery will cause you to grow another head that is listening to the outer ones (+ 1 whenever you roll omens up to your maximum). The seventh misery will cause you to reach your true potential and you shall fulfill the prophecy to devour the world in darkness.
4. **Crazed Corpulent Cannibalistic Compulsions**. As you grow fat on the flesh of your own kind, it becomes easy to become too accustomed to it. Every time you eat the entire body of a creature that has more maximum HP than you and is similar enough to yourself to be considered cannibalism roll 6d10, if you roll higher than your maximum HP, gain 1d6 maximum HP but lose 1 presence. If your presence is lowered to -4 or lower because of this curse, you lose all control and only seek to satiate your never ending desire for the taste of your own species.
5. **Wickhead's Worry**. If you are ever enveloped in dim light or darker, you must attack at every other living thing indiscriminately as you cannot distinguish between them and become immensely paranoid. If only you had a source of bright light that would never leave you
6. **Chimera Causing Curse**. Whenever you touch another animal, roll a d20, on 11-20 that animal becomes a part of you as you gain features of that animal. On a 1-10 you become a part of the greater whole that is that animal, losing your free will.

8. **Gentlescum's Baptism Supreme**. Eating a maggot or worm found on deconsecrated ground invites the warm embrace of the Worm God.You slowly transform into a sentient hivemind of worms from the inside out.

9. **Eerta's Fever**. After taking a batch or drinking from a river where a witch's ashes ended, the character is feverish for a day, with all their stats at 2. On the second day their face wrinkles, turning into Eerta's face. They roll d4 for Agility and Strength and 3d8 for Presence and Toughness, gaining 3 random unclean scrolls. There can be lots of Eertas and their only motivation is to wreak havoc.
10. **The Thousand Fangs**. After being attacked by a vicious cursed canine, d2 rabid wolf mouths break out from inside the infected character (Location d6: 1. head 2. right arm 3. torso 4. right leg 5. left arm 6. left leg), bite d6 damage, infectious 3 on a d6 possibilities of being infected. Each dawn another d2 mouths appear, when two mouths are on the same location, it breaks. If it is in the head or torso, the character dies.

13. **Triskeletonidekaphobia**. Robbing different resting places isn’t a good idea for the superstitious as it can have grave consequences.

14. **'That inside’ Possession**. The character kills, suddenly and involuntarily, a random person, don't know why or how, he only did it.

15. **Blood Sweat Glue Sickness**. The infected character starts to sweat blood, it causes no damage, but feels the need to touch other living beings, mixing and melting with them. Each human absorbed gives +d4 to their strength, big creatures add d8, small animals d2. It melts after d4 days.
16. **Ivory Delight**. Bonemeal, ground from the unearthed of Graven-Tosk, dissolved in the gore of a blood-drenched skeleton. Upon cursing, the inflicted is struck with an insatiable appetite to gnaw bone. As more is ingested their body is consumed by spindly calcified protrusions until they are naught but what they crave.

18. **Metaldermis**. An affliction causing patches of metal to coat your skin and eventually turn you into a statue, only consuming other sources of metal can halt the spread. Every day that you go without eating 100 silver pieces worth of metal, the metal on your skin will spread, increasing the armor tier of your skin by 1 but also stiffing your joints for -1 agility. When your agility is reduced to -4 or lower, you are now a metal statue.
19. **Gnollish cackling**. Being bitten by a gnoll can result in abrupt bouts of mad laughter. Once a day, the DM can make the afflicted player roll a presence DR12 at anytime. Failing the roll causes the cursed player to laugh madly. Rolling a 1 on d20 for this roll causes the laughter to last a minute where the transformation into a gnoll occurs.
20. **DEATH20**. Through seriously horrid and deprived processes, the dwarves were able to mold still living flesh into that of a icosahedron with each side numbered with their bone. This crime against geometry and humanity lashes out mindlessly. (Man-eating D20) HP:20, Damage roll: 1d6, No armor, Moral: 10 Special: Strength DR16 to roll the human sized flesh die. If the Man-eating D20 has the 20 side come up, the curse is undone, returning them to normal. If the 1 side is up, it crumbles to ash.
