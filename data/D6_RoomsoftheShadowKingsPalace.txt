D6 Rooms of the Shadow King's Palace
subtitle:
category: The Dying World
1. **The Hall of Weirding Windows.** The hall is layed out like a traditional portrait gallery but instead of portraits in each place is hung a window of various style, size etc. No window shares the same view and all views are equally horrible, ranging from the a black desert made of beetles to a mid air view of Bergen Chrypt. Best not smash one who knows what will happen.
2. **Servants Quarters.** Behind a hidden door you find the quarters of the personal servants of the court. It looks abandoned for decades and yet soothing candlelight shines from a sole candelabra. A small kitchen and four bunk beds surround the rooms central table. The heavy tick-tocking of a grandfather clock ever present. 
3. **Hall of Paintings** You pass by a great hall, with doors and stairs connecting to multiple places in the castles. The walls are covered in dillapidated paintings of people and landscapes in embellished frames. The ones closer to the ground had their paintings ripped off, leaving only an empty frame. Some paintings have holes where the eyes would be and you swear you can see someone watching through them on your peripheral vision.
4. **Shadow Princes' Cruciation Chambers.** You find yourself in one of the many dens of cruelty belonging to the Shadow King's sons. Adorned in equipment and utensils to assist them in their avaricious and callous ways, they rarely offer anything in comfort. Each is as varied as whichever son plies his favored torture on some unfortunate of the day.\n\nRoll 1d6:\n1. Pompous Pain(tings): 1d4 Paintings of past cruelties. Some demented souls would pay well; 200s each. Refer to 6 if attempting to steal any(no Prince, just 1d4+1 Guards).\n2. Observe the Gore: A larger one with an observation gallery above for a few dozen guests. Nothing is happening, thankfully.\n3. Guests of Honor: You and your party have been invited by a Shadow Prince to witness a torture. DR 10 Presence check to steel oneself during the show or retch up your last meal. Failure or interfering, refer to result 6.\n4. Surgeon's Ward: The Prince here is an anomaly. Offers the best available medicines and services, as he is practiced in healing. All party members regain lost health and are given d4 Bandages; 50s. May only be rolled once, this result reverts to same as 3.\n5. Empty Chamber: There seems to be no Prince, victim, or guards present. Let alone anything valuable.\n6. Active Torture: The guards bar you from getting close, the Prince asks you to leave. Interfering causes combat. Loss will guarantee your place as the next victim(s).\n(d4+1 Guards - HP: 8  Morale: 8  Guard Armor: -d4  Fine Sword: d6+1 Shield: -1 dmg;\nShadow Prince - HP: 10 Morale: 9  Black Plate: -d6  Tormenter's Razorglove & Blade: d6 each, DR14 Toughness on hit or fall prone in excruciating pain for 1d6 minutes.) 
5. **The Chamber of the Forsaken Heir** Even attempting to recall how you found this place to begin with causes your head to ache and your mind to spin... All you manage to muster are vague recollections of grandiose winding passages, narrow corridors and cramped halls. The only thing your dazed mind finds itself sure of is this: you should not be here. The scattered remnants of a shoddy attempt to brick this passage off make that much clear to you. A half-built stone wall, overturned carts, ancient tools rusting away in the dust... It's almost as if whoever had been attempting to seal it off could bare being here no longer and fled. It is clear to see why.\n\nAn immense, immovable iron door caked with rust and furrowed with millions of scratch marks stands in the centre of a hand-carved cavern somewhere deep in the labyrinthine depths of the palace. Its exterior possesses every kind of lock known to man and a few intricate, complex mechanical ones you have never seen before for good measure. An inscription is engraved into the surface of the ancient metal:\n\n"The coming of the end shall be a blessing, for only this shall forever preserve us from THEM."\n\nThe inscription has been disturbingly vandalised however, as the words:\n\n"Will the end be enough?" have been crudely etched over it.\n\nBeyond the door lies a cell, within which there resides a secret that even the Shadow King himself desires to bury. A horrific mistake connected to things far greater than the pitiful dying realm. It would be wise to leave this discovery to rot in the dark and perish in the furious wrath of the Seventh Misery. Turn back. 
6. **The lost room.** A room with no door leading there. How did you get here? Where is this room anyways? No doors, no windows. One wall is just bookshelves, one is just torture devices, one is just kitchen stuff and the 4th wall is empty, seemingly the wall you came through. There might be a long forgotten powerful item in here, also a switch to open a secret door that leads anywhere where the GM pleases. But beware of using magic in here, it fumbles on 1-4 as the walls laugh at you.
