subtitle:
category: Lost Souls All
1. **Friar's Slumber**: Taste and odourless poison, Toughness DR10 or die. Awaken again in d6 hours. You will remember everything you have seen or heard during the false death
2. **Red trollcap**: Devour this mushroom and grow to double size for an hour. Equipment is unaffected. Plate armor is ill-advised. The effect is cumulative.
3. **Lizard's spit**: Smells like weird patchouli. 2 hours after taking it, the skin of its user starts to fall in wet greenish flocks, losing social capabilities for another 2 hours. After changing all their skin, they recover all their HP.
4. **Snake Oil**: After ingestion, test DR6 Presence. On success the buyer sees through the scam. Otherwise they falsely believe themselves cured of all afflictions and become fanatic for this miracle-potion. Willing to buy it for up to 100sp per vial.
5. **Doll tear**: smells like burnt rubber. After drinking it, the PC talks with the voice of a small child for an hour. People feel an urge to protect them for as long as they are not seen.
6. **Acid of Nzut**: Smear this foul slime on a limb and it will detach. It is still alive and can be controlled by its previous owner (1-in-6 chance that it forms a vicious, murderous mind of its own).
7. **Stoneskin tonic**. Resist up to 2d6 damage. Effects last for d4 hours; then, the user suffers all the endured damage at once.
8. **Cave Rot**: Rapidly calluses skin to stone, extra -d4 to damage taken. If not cured within 3 hours consumer's petrification is complete. Brittle skin encases all.
9. **Eviscerating lilies**: Smells like candy. Its drinker loses d2 hp but the next living creature they spit on, shits itself to death. (1 in 6 chances its drinker ends having bleeding diarrhea).
10. **Nosferaleaves**: smells like hot wine with rust. The pc loses 1d4 hp after drinking it but when near other living creatures, they drain 1hp per creature for the next 10 turns. After burning their adrenaline, they sweat blood until reaching d4 hp.(modificato)
11. **Distilled troll essence**. Probably best not to ask how itâ€™s made. Effect lasts 10 turns. D6. 1-2: Receive double damage. 3-6 Deal double damage.
12. **Bug Powder Dust**: Granulated for application to body. To wall crawl, test DR 7 Strength. After 1 hour, molt and completely shed your skin.
13. **Wickhead Wax**. Slick and greasy. After drinking, a blazing beam of light emits from your mouth whenever you open it for an hour afterwards, providing excellent illumination.
14. **Groutespunge**. Cleans the dirt off of most anything. Removes infections when rubbed on skin. Burns through organic material at 1 inch per minute (deals d6 damage for each round of contact).
15. **Psylosoup**. Earthy taste. Become attuned with nature. +4 when using Presence in a natural environment or when using Powers. -4 to everything else.
16. **Dentalligoo**. Frothy, white, burns going down. Makes bones and teeth extremely hard - you have -d4 armor vs. blunt weapons and you can eat almost anything until you rest, allowing your bones to settle once more.
17. **Cobweb holes**: Smells of dirty wet clothes. Its user can walk up walls and ceilings for an hour but will be shitting spider eggs and pering cobwebs until the next dawn.
18. **Liar's Milk**. The taste and texture of sweet milk. Test Presence DR16 or speak only lies for the next d4 hours.
19. **Grenouille's Sauce**: Makes anything this sauce is put on digestible. Addictive. Test Toughness DR12 after every meal.
20. **Explosive Vial**. Vibrates rapidly and detonates on impact. Everyone within a radius of 15 feet must test AGI DR14 or take 2d6 damage from a blast of black flame. Don't drop or jostle.
21. **Mossmories**: Smells like old people. Its drinker quickly gets covered in moss and vanishes. They are puked by the nearest moss formation, losing d4 hp.
22. **Basilisk Tears**: Liquid droplets. Take d2 damage for use. Test DR 10 Presence to gain outlined sight of all religious NPCs and enemies (Cretonians, Inquisition, Heretics, etc.). If failed, gain intractable visions of the Realm of the Dead for 1 day.
23. **Acsauhaya**: After a sip, turn immune to physical damage for 1h. Magic damage received multiplied by 4.
24. **Detox Tea**: Causes sins to be vomitted up. 3d4 damage, free of infections & cured of bad habits afterwards.
25. **Black Monstrosity**: Thick pitchblack liquid. Liquifies your insides. Why would you drink this?
26. **Green Return**: Applied to a surface (any surface!) said surface will turn to earth and grow roots. A tree begins to grow and will reach a remarkable size after only 3 days.
27. **Slate Vial**. Full of dull grey liquid. Nullifies the effect of any other concoction. Herbmasters need something to fix their many mistakes.
28. **Vial to Wine**: All liquid poured into this vial turns to wine. Works 1d4 times. A normal vial afterwards.
29. **Blacksmith's Sip**: Smells like iron. Once drinked, the pc pukes all over themselves (d2 damage) gaining medium armor (-4 damage, tier 2) wherever it covered them, until the next dawn. Stinks horribly and attracts flies.
30. **Sculptors Muse** - Smells like marble and sweat. Applying a half dose causes the target to naturally gain one tier of armour. A full dose rapidly and painfully turns the target into a marble statue. DR12 presences test to correctly apply the desired amount.
31. **Serrated Salt**: rendered from blood-cursed bogwater into a fine silvery powder. Any person consuming the Salt, even when diluted in other material, takes 1 damage and cannot speak for d4 hours. Compacting two doses of the Salt together causes their spikes to grow further, making the combined dose deal d4 damage and allowing it to be used as caltrops.
32. **Extract of the Suffering Heretic**: a faint smell of smokes comes from the oily orange liquid. To be effective, must be applied onto the skin and then burned into it. Grants the user unlimited Omens for d8 hours. Everytime the user activates an Omen during this time, their Max Health decreases by 1 until the end of the concoction's effect.
33. **Poulterghastial Flowerhash**: Smoking this feathery bluish mess grants one d3 free uses of the Te-Le-Kin-Esis spell.
34. **Crucifixian Balm**: The cross-wood is ground into a reddish paste that stinks of sulphur. Apply this concoction to a weapon to grant it an extra d4 damage against undead and demons until the Balm loses potency.
35. **Necrodust**. Inhaling these vapors allows you to take on the appearance of a corpse for D4 hours. Incredibly hallucinogenic, upon failing a DR12 toughness test, target becomes convinced that they are actually dead, will disregard all danger.
36. **Wedding Ring Tea**: This warm tea, made from a medley of dried weeds, is named for its copper colour, sweet metallic taste, and a not-so-secret ingredient. Regain d2 HP upon drinking and grants a +1 bonus to any ability of the drinker's choice for d4 hours. Adding a wedding ring, of any size or value, during the brewing process will change the effect of the doses created. The altered doses will heal d4 HP, cure infection, and grant a +1 bonus to all the drinker's abilities for d6 hours. The wedding ring is destroyed in the brewing process.
37. **Berzerker's Lipstick**: Red like viscera and stinking of it too, this pasty lipstick is put exactly where you think, fool. The Lipstick grants a +1 bonus to Strength Rolls and a burning Kiss attack. This melee attack requires close range, deals d4 damage, and reduces the DR of the next attack targeting the same target by 2. Whenever you land a Kiss attack, roll a d4. On a 1, the lipstick smears off and is no longer effective. Otherwise, the lipstick loses it's potency after 2d4 hours.
38. **Imaginary Spinal Fluid**: an invisible liquid that smells of rotting lavender, injected into a vein. For the next d10 hours, this concoction will grant a +3 bonus to Strength and Agility tests as long as the user has not broken any of the concoction's Imaginary Morals. Rolls 3d8 on the table below to determine these Imaginary Morals. IMAGINARY MORALS (d8): 1) Do not swear in the presence of heretics, 2) Do not mention Nechrubel or the Basilisks without kissing the air twice immediately after, 3) Gamble once every hour, in the least, 4) Insult any priest you encounter as horribly as possible, 5) Do not fight with both hands full, leave one to hold the hand of God, 6) Do not partake of booze brewed at night-time, 7) Bow to each monster before you fight them, 8) Carry torches in the hand you write with
39. **Bravery of the Dead Rat**: a marinated rat's head wreathed in dried flowers must be eaten to gain its boons. Crunchy, sour, and scratches the tongue. For d6 days, any food that would normally infect or disease you cannot and vice-versa. In addition, you gain immunity to all orally consumed poisons and acids.
40. **Saintly Smegma**: a grainy yellow cream applied directly to the face. For d8 hours, the DR of Presence and Toughness tests you undertake are randomly increased or decreased by 6. You may end this effect at any time by washing your face with holy water.
