D8 Debts to Pay
subtitle:
category: Plots, Portents, and Lies
1. **A lost bet to one of Anthelia’s generals** Why would you be so stupid to make that bet? You know that not keeping your word to Anthelia and her closest will not end well. And here you are… No Kergüsian clams, and no sparks of life and colour. And they’ll be here any second now.
2. **Faustian Pact** When you made that deal with the lone nomad at the crossroads you did not know the lengths to which you would have to suffer. All for mastering Insert skill (+d4 to certain ability check but also lower toughness by two steps)
3. **The child friend who lend you an apple** Well they recognized you. And they want their apple back. What do you mean the world is ending and there is hardly fresh fruit? The "old friend" being part of the inquisition doesn't help either. 
4. **A Royal's Treasury** A long time ago one of your ancient ancestors was a master thief and they stole all the gold of a kingdom, you need to pay it back but due to interest it has grown to a absurd amount, specifically 1d100 * 1d100 * 1d100 * 1d100 silver 
5. **The Debt Of Life** "Yes, I suppose that withered, animated corpse shambling towards us does resemble my late mother. Yes, it is wearing the same clothes I buried her in. No, I absolutely do not wish to find out why she is screaming 'A LIFE FOR A LIFE' while growing ever-closer. Let's run. Let's run now." 
6. **Occult Healers Demand Payment** A while back you when you had almost died, you woke up in a temple that belonged to Occult Healers. They healed you, and then took all of your possessions but the value came no where close to what the required. They set you free to earn your repayment. They're back. They demand 666 silver.
7. **That guy was a lich?** Turns out that hooded frail man who gave you an Unclean scroll a while back was a lich. He is now back and demanding a Sacred scroll as payment.
8. **Weirdo in the walls.** You hear "Pssh oi! Yeah you there." turning around you see a weird bloodshot eye peering at you from a hole in the wall , it offers you a way out of what ever hellish dungeon you've got lost in. Months later the eye returns, this  time though its in your walls and it wants you to offer it a way in....
