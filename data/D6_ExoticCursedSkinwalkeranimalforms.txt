D6 Exotic Cursed Skinwalker Animal Forms
subtitle:
category: Lost Souls All
1. **Puking Panda**. You are cute (+2 to reaction roll), fluffy (-d4), but most of all queasy. DR10 Presence to project pungent panda puke. d4 damage + special: -2DR to track and to hit. Or just use your claws (d6).
2. **Colossal Crustacean** Big enough to fill a small room, this crab has a hard shell (-d6), giant pincers (d8 + Grapple), and can molt to heal 2d4hp over 10min, but then takes double damage for 10 minutes while a new shell grows from their squishy body.
3. **Fluffy Werelion**. On a full moon this powerful creature will rampage, looking for blood. His silverish long hair will reflect the moonlight. Fangs 1d10 dmg, DR10 to hit, because it's BIG. Enough HP to make him scary. Once a skinwalker in this form tastes human blood, there's an incremental chance of 5% a round that he liked so much, he wouldn't return his orginal form. Wait for the next moon phase. If the villagers will let you live till then.
4. **Corpsegrinder Centipede**. Eating, biting, running. Three feet long, a foot thick, with giant, pinching teeth and a glassy-black carapace. The mindlessness of an eternal hunger makes the skinwalker forget everything but their aching stomach, going into a beserk feeding frenzy. Each bite is 2d8 damage and the skinwalker must pass a DR18 check to do anything other than biting once they start (even if the biting is ineffective). When the target dies, the skinwalker will move to the next nearest living thing, friend or foe. Only when nothing living is within sight will the centipede start eating, requiring a DR12 to disengage or transform back into its human form. Corpsegrinder Centipedes are hated and reviled by most intelligent races and are killed on sight.
5. **Brain-eater squid**. When in squid form, any round where you are grappling an enemy creature with a brain in its head, you can use your action to suck its brain out. Any creature that needs a brain to live is killed instantly. Otherwise the attack is gruesome but ineffective. Upon consuming a brain, roll Get Better but only as to Presence. You can move swiftly underwater but have trouble traveling significant distances on land
6. **Mirror Moth**. This demonic giant insect has an incantation written in a pattern on one of its wings for a random sacred scroll, another wing has a reflection of that incantation for a random unclean scroll, you can only cast either in this form. If you see a spell being cast, you can expend a power and roll presence DR16 to reflect the spell back onto the caster. If you fail the presence roll the spell instead does maximum damage and last for maximum duration. You can only take this form at night, +4DR to all rolls if there is **LIGHT** around.
