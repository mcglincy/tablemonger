One day, shipfuls of starving folk from the world beyond the Endless Sea came to Galgenbeck for refuge. Kristian Tyrann took almost one-hundred folk in and gave them a bargain - if they worked constructing a tower, he would allow them to stay in shelter and food.\\n\\n The tower took fourteen years to construct, during which time he drew his plans with his engineers. The tower was seven stories, among the highest outside Galgenbeck, and was intended as a forge and center of research for mighty tools to aid Galgenbeck's dominion. When the tower was constructed, Tyrann ushered his workers inside and gave them a sermon.\\n\\n When they emerged, they rallied a blood tax - five victims for every man, woman, and child who died working on the tower. Over a hundred people were dragged into the tower. The year of horrible research that proceeded is spoken of only in the harshest whisper, the deepest privacy. Kristian Tyrann created the Executioners and bound them to his will. He invented the thirteen suffering engines, which draw power from the victim inside and slay countless men. He wrote the twisted **Alchemic Pain Manual**, a treatise on the art of suffering.\\n\\n When Galgenbeck cast him out, killed his following, and destroyed his home, Nechrubel was swift to pick him back up. His research is elsewhere now, fortified beyond even Galgenbeck's power to destroy. He improves on his projects, suffused with the will of Nechrubel. And he creates new nightmares every day, full of joy at his boundless creativity that pleases even Nechrubel.\\n\\n Kristian Tyrann has 1 HP, Morale 6, No armor, and a small sharp tool 1d4 HP. ***He is only a man.***"
