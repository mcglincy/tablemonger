subtitle:
category: The Dying World
1. **The Cackling Saint**. When St. Elphred was excommunicated, witnesses said that she threw her head back a laughed maniacally while her body exploded into the heavens forming a new constellation. Those born under the sign of St. Elphred are especially good humored, pious, and prone to madness. Compatible with Water signs.
2. **The Void**. "That space up there, with no stars in it. It sort of looks like... something. I swear there used to be a constellation there, but it's just a clear shape of nothing now."
3. **The Scribe**. A quill shaped constellation etched in the sky as clearly as your own ability of recollection. Those born under The Scribe are blessed with superb memory, so good they often have memories that are not their own.
4. **The Whip**. It seems to you like any random string of stars can be called the Whip, but whatever. Stands for good love life or financial disaster. Or both.
5. **The Basilisk**. A writhing basilisk shaped constellation. It's said any who are born under that sign are split from birth. Two minds In one body vying for dominance just as their name sake. Never trust a Basilisk....
6. **The Eye**. Two curved strings of stars with a shifting, luminous vortex in the centre. Those born under this sign are said to posses insight and introspection beyond that which human minds should be capable of. Their dreams are ever-haunted by glimpses of far off realms.
7. **The Goblin**. You spotted this complicated pattern amongst the stars? Good for you! You now suffer the Goblin Curse! Which Goblin to kill to set you free you ask? Who knows! (it's a goblin on the moon)
8. **The Teeth**. A collection of stars that are arranged into a large mouth. They seem to get closer every passing day. Good thing they're just stars...right?
9. **The Femur**. Long chain of stars mildly reminding of the femur bone. Those born under this sign seem to have strong bones and body composition. And also really weird taste for marrow. 
10. **The Troll**. A baby troll patter of starts. Every times someone looks at it, seems to be bigger. Legend says "When fully grow it will devour you!". 
11. **The Great White**. A small patch of light that bears directly overhead most nights, those who spend too much time staring into the abyss will find that the abyss stares back. Those born under the great white are incapable of compassion, clearly a sign of the end.
12. **Yetsabu-Nech**. The ever present celestial body causing an infinite black space in the clearest of starry nights. As it aligns with The Femur, it shall be seen as a bad omen. Often hunted down as heretics, people born under Yetsabu-Nech are said to be able to speak in tongues and have prophetic dreams.
