D20 Festivities
1. **Rotfest**: Celebrated right inbetween the longest and the darkest day, the centre piece of Rotfest are the Rottreats hanging around the place. These criminals, hung from trees, are fed with small presents right before their execution. This way, when they hang for quite some time and children beat them enough with sticks, their guts will explode and the presents will pop out.
2. **The Small Leap**: Annual senicidal ättestupa event where the old and frail of Grift are taken to Terion to be cast down into the sea, followed by a feast and a long day and night of drinking. This tradition is said to be a kind of sacrifice to the cliff, hoping it will ensure a swift and theomantically powerful death to the many once the preparations are done and the time has come for The Big Leap.
3. **Lovers' Trail**: Spring festivity for which random travellers are abducted. Chained in pairs, they are forced to walk through an obstacle course while whipped by the elder couples of the village. It continues until one of the 'lovers' dies. The surviving one is knocked out and will wake up in an unknown road the next morning with the chain they used as a necklace.
4. **Blutday**: The biennial breaking of the Blutday blood bread is a sacred institution in Tveland, carefully overseen by the clergy. The blood, historically spilled by sixty-six saints and stored in secret obsidian jars is the base of the bread (other important ingredients are ashes, beer and monkey spit) and is said to still hold fragments of their hallowed spirits. Of all those who eat of the bread, only a few will see the Grim Visions. And of them, only a few are taken by the Two-Headed Basilisks to bear witness in the innermost chamber of the Grand Cathedral’s Sunken Choir. What happens then is shrouded in mystery. But the public festivities surrounding the Breaking of the Bread are considered one of the holiest of events, especially in Galgenbeck.
5. **Mittens**: Sport played in parts of Tveland. Rules and Regulations: -The field is 2000 meters long and 8¾ meters wide (previously 2000x9). -Teams consist of: A Baskin, a Quarterback, 19 Hillsmen, and 10 Miscellaneous -The goal of the Baskin is to get the team's potted flower from one end of the pitch to the other. That’s worth 1 point. -If a bird comes in the field and you catch it, that’s 700 points. -Baskins are also required to eat disgustingly hot items, study foreign languages, and many other difficult tasks. -Games take about 2 weeks. -Players may kill each other for acceptable reasons. Acceptable reasons that a player can kill another on the field include: -->Entering another players line-of-sight without permission -->Mispronouncing another teams name -->If a player has ever committed adultery, intentional or otherwise. -At anytime in the first third of a game either team may demand the game start over. (These restarts can extend matches for weeks.) If a team breaks a rule, the other team loses a player, which leads to teams breaking the rules on purpose. Teams often counter this by distracting the referee or knocking them unconscious so they don't notice the other team breaking a rule. -You may strike the enemy team with a wooden chair. Metal chairs are illegal. -If you prepare a frittata on the field you must wear gloves.
6. **The Annual Galgenbeck Eat Till You Die Fest!**: Every year, participants and viewers from all over the country gather to the city of Galgenbeck for the largest eating contest. The eaters are locked to their chairs with a tube stuck down their throat, and the feeding commences. Dedicated altarboys shove any available food down the participants' throats. This continues until either the food runs out, or until the eaters explode. Their remains are cooked in a tasty stew gifted to the winner of the contest.
7. **Svampfest**: Once a year when conditions are just right, the chosen are sent deep into the tangled forests of Sarkash seeking the hallowed Verhushroom. It is almost indistinguishable from the myriad of lethal fungi that litter the forest floor, but for the learned it is known by the its double-headed growths. It is believed that consuming enough of these will gift the eater with the the foresight of Verhu, if only for a scant few hours. Unfortunately none have ever returned to prove the beliefs to be true and all that remain are the fungi infested remains of the chosen.
8. **Winter Day's Sweeps-takes**: A Schleswig favorite where the people welcomes winter by cleaning out the sweep urchin remains from the city's many chimneys. The event ends with a communal burning of the leftovers and the raffling of anything usable. Traditional songs known as charr-olds are sung by next year's chimney sweeps.
9. **Hunt for Dead Oktober**: An annual celebration on the darkest night of the year. Monsters, beasts, and undead of all kinds are released into the streets while the townsfolk compete to slaughter the most creatures, saving the town from sure destruction. Some villages have been overrun, unable to defend themselves. Why do we keep celebrating like this?
10. ****The Unfathomable Holy Hour of Obligation: Across the land, mystics cease activity and begin a trance. They commune with the unknown in search of a path to Cube-Violet. Many are left immovable and unable to escape their meditative state.
11. **Bonfire of the Obscenities**: A spontaneous uprising by peasant folk in Schleswig. Sacred and Unclean Scrolls are gathered to be publicly burned in the city streets.
12. **Bakers Dozen**: after harvest, the village baker produces thirteen identical cakes, but one is made of the spoiled grain left behind. Each cake is portioned into thirteen slices, and all the slices are mixed. Those who attend the revelries and dancing early enough will enjoy one slice. By evening, the Bakers Dozen are beset by wild, violent, and grim visions of the void. As the Dozen writhe and shout, sweat and howl, their fellows celebrate their fortune; and good fortune indeed for everyone if all thirteen die. It is a grave omen indeed if any of the Dozen survive their ecstasies; misery, starvation, deprivation will surely follow such survivors back into the community. The priest is expected to help ensure good fortune, but certainly only by prayer and the application of firm, vigorous exhortations of goodwill.
13. **The plague sprint from Galgenbeck to Grift**: Every time something foretold by Verhu comes to pass the great bells of Galgenbeck tolls. Seven champions from beneath the cellars of the holy Cathedral volunteering to participate in the plague sprint march out in the sacred chains. In a seven hour march they approach the holy sanitarium where they each ingest one of the seven bodily fluids produced by the patients staying there. After this a seven hour rest in the intensive ward is given to the champions before they are, at the set of midnight, sent out to carry the newest foretellings of Verhu together with one sacred companion to king Sigfúm the Kind. The journey is to be traveled in the bare flesh with only the protection of the companion wrapped around the naked skin. The companions given to each champion before departure are one the following. 1) A pale but fat yellow snake, as starving as the champion itself. 2) A big, soft and hairy spider with venomous protection. 3) A host of very small scorpions covering each inch of the champions skin. 4) A pack of dirty rabid dogs 5) A small horse, strapped to the body of the campion, dead for a few weeks. 6) A several inch thick layer of hunny smeared across the skin of the champion and a starving bear on a leach. 7) Sixty six different species of flees, evenly spread across the body in a generous amount.
14. **Deathmilk Day**: Deathmilk is a liquor brewed by distilling the ferment blood of virginal creatures. Certain animals may impart different tastes upon the deathmilk, but it is a general rule of thumb that the older the animal is, the higher quality the Deathmilk will be. This annual drinking festival is sponsored by Salusterheim, the largest brewer of Deathmilk on the continent. Salusterheim throw a massive celebration in Schleswig, Galgenbeck, and Grift selling rare bottles of high-quality liquor. Another party is thrown for any who make the pilgramage to their headquarters in the Valley of Unfortunate Undead. Determine the price of a random bottle of Deathmilk at such a festival by rolling on the following tables: Roll a d10 for the Creature of Fermentation: 1) Dog (d2), 2) Monkey (d2), 3) Cow (d4), 4) Pig (d4), 5) Goblin (d4), 6) Sheep (d6), 7) Human (d8), 8) Wyvern (d8), 9) Berzerker (d10), 10) Troll (d10). Roll a d10 to determin that creatures Length of Virginity: 1) Under a month (x10s), 2) Between a month and six (x15s), 3) Between six months and a year (x20s), 4) one to five years (x25s), 5) five to fifteen years (x30s), 6) fifteen to thirty years (x35s), 7) thirty to forty-five years (x40s), 8) forty-five to sixty year (x45s), 9) sixty to eighty years  (x50s), 10) More that eighty years (x100s). Then add 10d10s to the price if the age is beyond the animals natural lifespan. Deathmilk makers have their ways, and they are very expensive.
15. **Hunt of Bastard Wolves**: Popular in forested regions like Graventosk and larger Sarkash. A wild dog or wolf is shaved, painted in secret runes that only the community elder knows. It is then released into the wild during the early morning of the hunt. The festivity's particapants spends the day carving horns and instruments that immitate the howls of the wolf, then go out at night to hunt it. The hunter who lures the right hound and brings it back to the elder, dead or alive, is given a prize for their craftiness. Failure to capture the hound can have grave consequences for the village!
16. **Fyreday**: Celebrated once a week, usually with cheers of "Praise Nechrubel its Fyreday!" The details of this weekly tradition is for disgruntled workers to usurp their employer after a weeks worth of work and throw their corpse on the town pyre. Whoever throws the body on the bonfire now has their incinerated victims job.
17. **Lantern Festival**: Celebrated once a year in autumn. All the names of the villagers are carved in different pumpkins whose inside flesh is scooped out, placing a candle inside them. During the festival a blindfolded 'volunteer' is given an enormous maze and is surrounded by the lanterns, if five random pumpkins are not smashed, killing in the act the people whose names are on them, all villagers under seven will die during the along next day.
18. **Music of the Un-Spheres**: All villagers have to make noise non-stop for 24 hours with whichever they have at hand. As soon as someone stops for more than 20 seconds, a dark winged shadow takes them to the clouds before leaving them fall in exactly the same spot where they got picked. It happens even inside the buildings...
19. **Sethkinfest**: An event dedicated to the "saving" of goblins via ritual sacrifice and rampant slayings. Bound criminals are use to lure goblins into caves and clearings where they are killed en masse by angry mobs. The goblin corpse are crushed and consecrated, then turned into a disgusting jam which is used in later festivities like eating competitions the same night.
20. **Scrollharvest**: Wizards are often kept chained and alone for months on end in preparation for a Scrollharvest. Once stripped and shaved of pointy hat and beard, they are skinned and turned into leather. Selected members of the town get to write love letters, deeds, damnations, and hymns upon the leather in hopes of creating new scrolls. A Wizard is a perfectly normal scroll material, in such an uncanny world as this.
