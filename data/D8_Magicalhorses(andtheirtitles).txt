D8 Magical Horses (and Their Titles)
1. **Heuseli, the Wranglemare of Múr**. They say one of the colossal bridges to Grift murders friends. Not in the literal sense, at least that’s not always the case. There is *something* living on or under that one bridge that will turn companions and comrades into enemies before they reach the other side. It begins with minor annoyances. Bickering. Arguing. Irritation. But as the mare rides them, night after night soon they will become sworn nemeses. There has been violence. Many former allies hurled off the bridge down into the bottomless depths. Once in Grift, whatever inspiration or hope you had when you set off have left you bitter, betrayed and probably alone.
2. **Haargus**. Haargus is a greying mare that looks every second its interminable age, yet somehow will not fall down and die. It can be ridden if you're particularly loathsome and sadistic - it travels half the movement speed of the slowest thing in the party. *Haargus will never die.*
3. **James Baxter**. James Baxter is a fine palomino horse with the amazing ability to not only walk on two hooves, but to have the balance of a acrobat and can often be seen traversing the dying world rolling on a large ball. Terrifyingly, this horse does not neigh but instead says it’s own name in a horrible mockery of a human voice.
4. **Patches, the Uncanny**. Sewn together from the remains of three other horses; Patches should not be, and is aware of the fact.\nUpon taking damage, Patches must roll a d10, and on a 0, one of its parts falls off and must be reattached or replaced.
5. **Bartholomew** *(do not give this horse a title)*. Yes, they can talk, but it is mostly regrettable. In passing you hear people mutter *“That horse is mediocre at best”*, *“I’d say painfully average”* and *“Wow, Bartholomew is not incredible, for sure”*. If ridden, take a -1 to all Presence tests and be included in the disappointment of everyone else.
6. **Mescaline the Horrid Mother**. An old mare in her final years developed a taste for flesh. Cursed by a horrid witch whose familiar went down the maw, Mescaline did not care and continues feasting. \n1d6 days after eating an alive creature she gives birth to the thing she ate, not the same way it came in. Let's hope it dies easy and Mescaline won't eat it again.
7. **Canterelle, the Midnight Mushrump**. From hoof to head covered in ever-creeping fungal growths that glow at night. In addition to being a nightlamp, Canterelle functions as a portable garden, producing four rations of mushrooms per day, provided she is kept well fed. She eats only fresh human meat, at a rate of one corpse per day. She will not hesitate to seek it on her own.
8. **Gascoigne, the Horse**. And a glorious horse at that, they have long pointy ears, a massive jaw filled with razor-sharp teeth. Haggard fur often stained red, strong hind legs and blades for claws. You can find Gascoigne deep in the woods at night by following their dreaded howl. Winner of the Schleswig *'Definitely a Horse’* competition, all other participants had mysteriously gone missing in the days before.
