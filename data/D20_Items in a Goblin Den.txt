subtitle:
category: Treasures & Trinkets
1. A bucket of rusty nails and broken glass.
2. Badly made knife with a handle on both ends. Bits of hair and blood on the blade.
3. A simple stick with a strong running from one end to the other to act as a make shift bow. Despite the wood looking rotten, it appears to function normally (on attack, rolling on or under 7 breaks it).
4. A torn up teddy bear thrown abandoned in the corner.
5. A bloated badger
6. Collection of unidentifiable teeth
7. Mummified goblin: “Granny”
8. A twitching, still-living Wickhead with all their limbs sawn-off. Functions as a lit torch for as long as it is kept alive.
9. The sign of the local inn; a bronze plate of a horse drinking beer.
10. Half a pocket watch, with bite marks around the edges
11. A finger-painted portrait of a goblin, and a small pot filled with the now drained and dessiccated fingers used to paint it.
12. Charred hands, probably used to stoke fire pits.
13. More goblins. Duh.
14. A gagged troll baby that just bit through its gag.
15. Small candlelit shrine filled with mementos of their former non-goblin life
16. A bucket filled to the brim with piss, feces and blood.
17. A Zweihänder! Made out of toenails, holds together through the magic of goblin saliva.
18. Three yellowish eggs. One has a small amount of old blood speckled on it.
19. A bunch of shiny rocks. They're pretty. A sign that says "Du Not Steal!!!!" next to it.
20. A stash of mud cakes and a recipe that is better left unread.
