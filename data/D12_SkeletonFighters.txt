D12 Skeleton Fighters
1. **Turtle kid**: Small and full of protuberant hard bones. You must succeed a DR12 Toughness test every time you hit them with a melee weapon or receive d2 damage; d4 if you hit them with your bare hands.
2. **Spiked Mike**. Covered in spikes, makes combat dangerous. On a fumbled defence test, PC is stabbed by a protunding bone taking 1d4 extra dmg. On skeleton's death, it shatters in a hundred tiny sharp bone projectiles, dealing 1d4 dmg in a small area.
3. **Powdered Craig**: This unfortunate skeleton has already been ground into bone powder. Through sheer force of necromatic will it can float through the air. It attacks by reforming bone fragments which it flings through the air at high speed (1d4).
4. **Ironbone**: Composed of solid black iron, itâ€™s hard to land a solid blow. Armor -d6. The metal claws take and break. d6 damage on a hit.
5. **The Flayed One**: An undead abberation that clothes itself in the skin of its victims, lying in wait for fresh kills. DR14 Agility or Presence to avoid its ambush, failure means d12 damage as it skewers you.
6. **Partial Skeleton**: This one's still got some bits left on him. Flesh dangles off the bones in tendrils. The creature desperately tries to attach any flesh others aren't using anymore to itself. Roll d4:
7. **Skull of the Glutton**. Even decapitation and excarnation could not extinguish the appetite of this long-dead titan. It can only move by rolling or by leveraging its immense jaw. Its awkward and immense bulk makes it easier to avoid (defense test is DR -2), but when it manages to catch you in its mouth the power can be devastating (damage d20).
8. **The Subjective Skeleton**. More aptly his name is Bregan. He doesn't think he's dead- this belief keeps him going. No amount of damage will harm him, the only way to undo this particular twist of fate is to prove to him that he is, in fact, dead. Bregan isn't actually hostile unless threatened. Can also be killed by convincing him that you are in fact killing him.
9. **FOPpy**. His bones keep getting harder. Even the remains of its clothes turns into bone. It becomes slower and slower, but more powerful.
10. **Bone Soup**: The skeleton of its last victim still floats in this bubbling broth of acidic slime, which eats through everything except bone. Hitting this creature with a non-bone weapon will cause the weapon to decrement one damage die, disintegrating if the weapon would fall below 1d4 damage. If it hits you, any non-bone armor you are wearing decrements one armor tier, disintegrating once it falls below tier 1.
11. **Finger Phalanx**: A legion of animated hand and finger bones assails you. On a failed defense roll they begin strangling you. To add insult to injury, they start turning out your pockets as well. Lose 1d4 hp and 1 random item each round unless you can succeed on a DR 16 str or agility (your choice) check to break their grip.
12. **Klashius Kranium**: The reigning champ has a jewel embedded in his skeleton for each opponent he has defeated. Naturally, he is studded with gems from head to toe. On a failed defense roll, roll d4: 1) Taunt: All DRs increase by 2 for one round. 2) Jab: He pops you right in the face for 1d6 damage. 3) Clinch: He grapples you. You can no longer attack, but instead may test Str DR 12 to break the grapple. Any round in which you are grappled, he automatically deals d4 damage. 4) Haymaker: He lays you out cold. Go to zero HP and roll on the broken table. You never should have even tried to take on the Champ.
