D10 You have successfully summoned a demon, but which one?
1. **Onhkar, the coachdemon**.  He can take you anywhere in exactly 1 hour 1 minute and 6 seconds.  The more difficult it is to get to the place, the more he charges per soul, although he is not interested in silver.  He is quite chatty so all passengers permanently loose 1 Presense after his "funny" stories about chilling and disgusting events. If you are brave enough, you can enter into a dialogue with him. Test Presense DR16, if successful, you can keep the dialogue in the desired direction. On Crit Onhkar casually shares a valuable secret with you. On fail, you accidentally spill out something that you later regret telling about.
2. **Caliborn, The Fallen Cherub.** It summons in form like bald jock with a skull instead of face, black frayed wings and a walking stick (d4 damage). At the moment when it understands his occurrence - it starts regurgitate a rays of green light (d10 damage) in everything he sees. It can be stopped if you offer him to play chess (Presence DR 10 for checkmate). It sucks at chess, but can manipulate time, so it can roll Toughness DR 12 to rewind time and don't be loser. If you win, you will have a irritated shouty tyrant with a motive to destroy the fucking world.
3. **Titivillus, a demon who doesn't forgive mistakes**. When you summon him, roll Toughness DR 18. If you fail, Titivillus change his body with yours. You can't go outside occult circle and your choice is to serve him or be unsummon and go to hell. If your success, you can enter in barter. Demon can give you information about mistakes of other people or creatures, but he needs Unclean Scrolls or free days without Hell.
4. **Lustful Succubus**. Cost: Mammal's Heart. The caster summons a cunning cutie, a lower demon that actively looking for victim's soul and forced to defend the caster for so long as the power can contain the demonic pact. Once each round after casting, the horned girl rolls 3d6: on any roll of 14 or higher, the demonic pact succumbs to demon's pressure and succubus breaks free. On a roll of exactly 13, the succubus choose caster as a target and captures his body and soul as a servant and sexual slave. **HP**: 12, **Armor**: Attraction d4 (DC14 for enemies, if success - without armour), **Weapon**: Whip d6+1,** Spell**: Seduce (Enoxian Syntaxix) 1 cast per 3 round.
5. **Wellak-Shalleigh, the Corrector** This incorporeal demon manifests solely as a sour, hot breath on the back of your neck. When you fail a DR test, the demon mansplains what you should have done differently. If circumstances permit, you may reroll the test—however if you fail again the demon instantly transports you to its home dimension, a reality of infinite and distilled condescension. You can rid yourself of the demon only by mansplaining something to someone else, though the whiff of its acrid breath will linger with you forever.
6. **Kharnsh Sword-Breaker** Two meters tall and rippling with powerful muscles, no doubt, Kharnsh could finish its enemies off with a single swing of its massive cudgel banded with row after row of heavy iron spikes. Instead, it prefers to toy with its prey, breaking down their weapons until nothing is left before growing bored and striking the finishing blow. HP: 15 Morale: 9 Armor: Demonic resistance -d4. Attack: Special—on a hit, reduce target’s weapon die type by one, to a minimum of d4–past that the weapon breaks. Once the target is out of weapons, the next hit will smash through armor, bone, and flesh to kill the target instantly.
7. **The Wound in Creation** A ragged gash in reality, from which an oily liquid constantly flows. Anything that touches the Wound is drawn into the spinning void and lost, perhaps forever. Shadow demons emerge from the Wound at a rate of about d3 per day. Some say the liquid that flows from the Wound is the Blood of Creation. Many magicians seek to understand it and unlock its secrets.
8. **Sturxex.** A flesh-colored, horse sized, centipede with translucent legs, hole filled carapace and human face appears in front you. It demands **1 silver** from the summoner. If you give it the silver it vanish, leaving behind a **random unclean scroll** that disappear when cast, successfully or not or at next daybreak, whichever happens first. Each dawn there is a** 1 in 4** chance the demon reappears, with a new random unclean scroll, demanding **twice** as much silver as the last time it appeared. If the summoner refuses the trade or the demon is attacked, the demon quickly and magically drain the summoners** hp for an amount equal the price it demanded** and fade out of existence. This damage can never be healed and the demon is never seen again by the summoner.
9. **The Liminal** A shadow? A roiling mass of fluttering whippoorwills? A human face swirled with a melancholy grin? The details are hard to make out as it flickers in and out of reality-as-you-perceive it. It savors the moment when life stands at the threshold of annihilation. If you fall to zero HP while near this creature but recover, gain 1d4 omens once you come to. Once this has occurred, your maximum HP drops to 1 until you figure out a way to foist the Liminal off on someone else.
10. **Ckurv'Jhinakch** The demon summoned is an appalling arthropodic beast of fused human body parts contained by black and iridescent chitinous carapace.  Faces, hands, and limbs appear in its joints.  Its head is comprised of a crab split down the middle.  In the rent space is a headless, humanoid body encased in brass.  The neck stump is eternally leaking blood into its mouth and to the ground at a steady trickle.  It immediately speaks into the mind of the summoner, asking for the sacrifice.  The summoner must make a DR 14 Presence test to convince the demon they and their companions are not the sacrifice.  Success directs it to the nearest non-party NPC, failure means it attacks.  **HP** 24 **Morale** n/a **Flesh Chitin** -d4 **Bloodcrunch** d4 **Special** Absorb - Any target taking DMG more than twice must succeed on a DR 12 STR or become absorbed into its Flesh Chitin.
