D6 Suspicious Scents
1. The sensually sour smell of a drug extracted from wyvern bile called serpent's kiss.
2. Basilisk sweat. You can never tell if it's fresh or stale...
3. Lavender. (watch out for Spiderdollies)
4. Troll Breath. You can't tell if it's coming from one that's still alive, maybe a severed head?
5. The smell of aromatic vegetables cooking with something acrid and vile.
6. Cotton candy. Must be a wizard nearby...
