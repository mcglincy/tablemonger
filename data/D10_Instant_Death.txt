D10 Instant Death
1. A hole opens up beneath your feet, swallowing you immediately
2. A dark suffocating vapor surrounds you. You die gasping in the presence you accidentally awakened.
3. A hole opens up above your head. A dead body flies out and breaks your spine upon impact.
4. A latent parasitic infection burst forth from your stomach. Biting flies swarm out of you as you breathe your last.
5. The dying world decides you're not worth it anymore. It's like you never existed.
6. The depthless black of the world's shadows reach out to you. Grabbed, you are torn limb from limb by the darkness itself.
7. Plague cart runs you down, splitting your skull and adding your brains to the other detritus of the muddy, squelching street. Should have looked both ways, I guess.
8. Immediately shit yourself to death. May you be remembered, peperony and chease.
9. The sound of a volcano erupts in the distance, a giant piece of molten rock lands on top of you.
10. Your hairs turn into steel maggots that immediately set upon you, hungering for wet flesh. Spend several hours writhing in exquisite agony, before expiring as your new friends reach your vitals.
