subtitle: 
category: The Dying World
1. Seven vertical scratches, hastily carved on doorframes or corpses.
2. Intestines in a figure 8 knot. Hung on the door of those hunted by the Grey Flayers.
3. In which is depicted a road towards a rising sun.
4. Three equidistant holes bored into a solid surface, something slimy moves between the holes when in the corner of vision.
5. "8:1" emblazoned over the Great Wolf that devours Verhu.
6. Nechrubel radiant, ascending as a dawning sun.
7. Four eyes stacked vertically, the upper and lower eyes staring towards the inner ones.
8. Two black crow's feet, tied to gnarled treeroot.
9. A Black orb or 9-pointed star supported by skeletal charioteers.
10. A single word seared in the flesh of the heretic: HOPE.
11. A contaminated and very small scar in the form of three cuts making a triangle, always done in their wrists, covered constantly with a solution that maintains the infection in that area and doesn't expand to the rest of the body. Leaving the cult means not having access to the solution letting the infection expand. After two weeks the infection reaches the heart, giving the ex-cultist a painful death. No permanent cure has been found.
12. A simple black gate with the word **NORTH** emblazoned in the center.
