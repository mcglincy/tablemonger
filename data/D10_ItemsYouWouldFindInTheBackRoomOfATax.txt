D10 Items You Would Find in the Back Room of a Taxidermy Shop

category: Treasures & Trinkets
1. An undead sewn in half dog. It's glistening and barks when touched.
2. A taxidermied human figure, still dressed in what it was able to scrounge up in the way of armor before it wound up here. It definitely didn’t just blink at you, right?
3. **Stuffed rats in a jar** Just ready to attach to any application that might need.... a stuffed rat...? 
4. **A spherical cat** It seems this cat was purposefully stuffed in order to make it as round as physically possible, its hide completely distended. If you shake it, something can be heard rattling inside.
5. **A completely true and genuine Sphinx** A dead woman’s preserved head sewn onto the body of some strange and foreign animal, with the wings of a vulture grafted on. It sits upon a great podium and on the bottom it reads, “Donated by Dr. Spencer Black” 
6. **Wolpertinger** A rare animal, to you it looks like a rabbit with duck wings, fangs, a fox's tail and deer antlers, but it looks very damaged. Someone might tell you; to catch one, you have to throw salt at it. They tell you also where to get one. They will pay a crazy amount to get a good specimen! What they don't tell you is that is is highly intelligent and it barfs arcane catastrophies.
7. **Your childhood pet goat, Tony** It's covered in dust and cobwebs, and Papa told you he ran off?! Tony still has the bell you put on him. 
8. D10+2 infected needles. Used for stitching. They're infected with something and already threaded, but who knows what they got the infection from, or exactly how it rots the puncture area to become inanimate.
9. Nothing, the room is spotless, not a fleck of dust on the barren floor, before you enterd into this room you swear you could hear a voice coming from it along with the glow of a lamp
10. **Arm in a sack** A burlap sack containing an embalmed human arm with a smudged tattoo on the forearm.
