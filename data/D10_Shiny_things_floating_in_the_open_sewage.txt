subtitle:
category: Treasures & Trinkets
1. Anuk Schleger™ Replica Sacrificial Dagger.
2. A tome drenched in sewage. The silver lock that holds it might still be worth a few copper.
3. Reflective conch shell. Smells like strangely sweet seawater and sounds like the ocean.
4. Your glass eye. How did that get there!?
5. The entrancing glow of an Angler-Gator's mutated lure.
6. A crown, your crown. Test Presence DR 14 (DR 16 for Wretched Royalty), on a failure memories of a past life as Lord of the Weeping Vale replace your own.
7. A dead Gold-crested Filth-crow.
8. A clenched monkey finger coated in silver, using a DR16 strength check to straighten it summons  a monkey that will stole something of value from the nearest church and give it to you, he won't be stealthy.
9. The Ring Hand of a Murdered Noble. Someone must have done a dirty job nearby, but forgot to take the proof back home. Where’s the rest of the body? Why does it only have seven fingers?
10. Two ended metal key, the ends are different or not!?.

The Gold-Crested Filth-Crow carries a feathery ring of shining gold around its collar, a perfect mockery for those unable to afford the real thing. It nests in the muck under latrines and seeks the treasure of the chamber pot.
